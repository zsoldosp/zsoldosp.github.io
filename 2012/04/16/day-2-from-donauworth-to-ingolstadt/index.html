    <h3><a href="/2012/04/16/day-2-from-donauworth-to-ingolstadt//">Day 2: From Donauwörth to Ingolstadt</a></h3>
  
    <div class="body">
        
<p>While one can see the daylight inside the tent, except when deep inside the sleeping bag, so it took me a while to wake up. Luckily for me, Canoe Club members were loading up boats next to me, so I finally did wake up.</p>
<p>I don't quite know why/how, but from waking up to leaving took me about two hours, without breakfast...</p>
<p>The I finally reached the Danube in a few kms. I was touched by the reunion (used to live in Budapest, but not anymore, and Crailsheim only has a really small river, not comparable to the Danube)</p>
<p>The day started with climbs, then I realized it is raining, which meant I would have to carry the backpack actually on my back. Bummer.</p>
<p>On reaching Neustadt I was disciplined enough to actually stop for lunch - I meant to grab a quick pasta, but what I thought to be a Vietnamese imbiss turned out to be a restaurant, so it took longer. Then k to my surprise - I have found a bicycle shop that was open, but unfortunately didn't have a tire that would properly fit the front. So I just bought a spare tube (I already had a flat this morning, and thus had no intact tubes. Plan to repair them in the evening).</p>
<p>Reading through the guide book I decided no to follow the Donauradweg to Ingolstadt, because there was mention of gravel, and dirt roads with potholes, so I took one running parallel to a main road, which was asphalted all the way. Of course, the irony is I got a flat nonetheless and that the potholed section of the gravel roads were after Ingolstadt. Fun. But it was nice to know a lot of cars stopped to see if all was OK (guess me searching for the hole in the tire must have looked odd from the outside).</p>
<p>Due to the rain, headwind, and dark, I stopped at the camping between Neustadt and Bad Gögging. It's still under construction (the Reception is a container), but has a heated showers block. It was needed after pitching the tent in the rain!</p>
<p>I got a smaller dinner, and remembered the advice that I shouldn't eat specialties too far away from their origin - this time the Wiener Schnitzel.</p>
<p>Km traveled: 100/97, cycling time:5:05, from start to finish: 8:30</p>
