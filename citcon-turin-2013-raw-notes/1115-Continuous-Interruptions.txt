Continuous Interruptions
=========================

e.g.: 3 team, N features, shared build machine with parallel feature tests
when the build is broken, everyone gets feedback about the broken build
information overload => "it's broken again, but surely not by me"
==> address feedback to specific committer (e.g.: mail/irc only to the committers involved in the changeset that triggered the build)
is anyone working on fixing it? => put a sticky on the monitor "I'm fixing it"
