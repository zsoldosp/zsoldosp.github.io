<p>Briefly about the conference - the open space format is still the best
thing since sliced bread as far conferences go, and CITCON still brings
together wonderfully smart people. Year after year I leave it being 
thankful for pointing me to questions (and answers) waaay outside the 
proverbial box....</p>
<h2 id="sessions-attended">Sessions attended</h2>
<p>This post does not contain <a href="/2013/10/08/citcon-turin-session-notes/">session notes</a> (I'm adding them to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/">wiki</a>) but rather just tries to convey the atmosphere/feel
of the sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Are_we_doing_improvement_wrong%3F">Are we doing improvement wrong</a></strong>? Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a>, 
  inspired by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Managing-Improvement-Adaptiveness/dp/0071635238/">Toyota Kata</a> book, it described the two 
  Katas, and illustrated why measuring improvement by the output 
  (results) only can lead to missed improvement opportunities (e.g.: the
  book describes that before an improvement effort, line managers were 
  called in for troubleshooting 1000 times a shift, which then decreases
  two 700 a shift. The leadership's response was that this means either</p>
<ul>
<li>people are hiding or working around failures, which is bad</li>
<li>people stopped improving, which is bad too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so they adjusted the workload to enable taking full advantage of
  the bandwidth of 1000 improvements/introspections the factory was
  capable of.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Continuous_Interruptions">Continuous interruptions</a></strong> Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KishenPanday">Kishen</a>, we dug deep
  into how interruptions can be a wonderful tool for knowledge sharing,
  mentoring and how they hide (or to be more precise, expose) risk 
  factors. I wish I had mentioned the urban legend about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#cite_ref-5">the QWERTY 
  keyboard layout's design origin</a>, but the point about 
  interruptions slowing you down enough to force taking a step back 
  didn't need analogies. And it seems we all have colleagues whose cell
  phones only ring when their owners, unlike the phones, are not 
  present...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_does_the_ideal_look_like%3F">What does the ideal software development process look like?</a></strong> 
  proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/aparker42">Andrew Parker</a>, closely linked to the first
  session of the day about improvement (towards the ideal one to one
  flow) is probably the one session that I left with more questions
  than answers - not just about the topic, or its conclusions (shorten
  the cycle time (effort) required for going from idea to getting
  feedback), but even about the open spaces framework (what if the 
  scribe wants to apply the law of two feet?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Low_level_test_code_/_library_bleeding_edge">Low level unit testing/assertion code patterns</a></strong> proposed by me,
  driven by my desire to learn what new ideas are present in this
  space. While I haven't learned of any new patterns, I left with a 
  much better understanding of how language embedded and enforced pre-
  and post-conditions (or code contracts in the C# world) can actually
  been tested, contrary to my initial assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Questions_on_the_right_level_and_amount_of_testing">Are we testing too much? / What's the point of code coverage? /
  Would a Test Tree Builder and Executor make sense?</a></strong> - this was a 
  merge of three topics, proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KishenPanday">Kishen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajmolenaar">Arjan</a>,
  and myself. It was the smallest session in attendance (it was the
  three of us and <a href="https://twitter.com/sietstweets">Cirilo</a>, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a> also popping by
  towards the end), but true to the spirit of open spaces, we were
  totally engaged. Plus <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a> demonstrated the need for more
  effectively transmitting information (when we brought him up to speed
  of what is being discussed, he just said "CITCON Australia 2009") or
  prior art - there is a kind of generational gap that exists between 
  programmer generations that could benefit from a few more bridges
  (though leaving enough of a divide so that people will still work on
  and solve problems that were previously declared "unsolvable"!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Had I not proposed any sessions, I would have loved to attend <em><a href="https://twitter.com/sf105">Steve 
Freeman</a>'s TDD Clinic</em> - it's always a pleasure to see great 
people perform, not to mention the learning opportunity. I also would
have liked to listen to <em><a href="https://twitter.com/ivanrmoore">Ivan Moore</a> describing the build setup
they have for their multi componented system</em> at work - I faced that 
problem years ago, topped with the plugin compatibility across multiple
versions problem, so would have loved to see what they did. And next 
time I'm in Budapest, I'll probably try to visit <a href="http://prezi.com">Prezi</a> again 
in case Jayson is around so I could take another look at their <code>fkt</code> 
system (and to listen to the <em><code>please</code>, <code>simply</code>, and <code>fkt</code> machine 
provisioning evolution story</em> again).  Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin">Zejko</a>'s 
session's about how <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> tests there system is easy to
find online, since - like everything else <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> does -,
it is open. But as I always say, it's so much better to leave a conf 
with too many good sessions than one with too little...</p>
<p>Another great aspect of CITCON is the dinner afterwards - even though
it splits into multiple small groups, it's real nice to talk with people
directly, both about non-tech (like explaining why it would
make a ton of sense for the Budapest Opera House to organize a summer
Opera festival) and tech (thanks to all who listened to my pet project 
ideas, and gave really useful feedback!)</p>
<p>The reunion-like feeling <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulJulius">PJ</a> mentioned during his opening remarks
was true for me too, but sadly I haven't prepared enough - I should have
organized more explicit catch-up sessions outside the conference, for I
couldn't chat with everyone I wanted to in enough depth - hard to do
when we are running additional sessions even during the lunch break!
Plus of course one doesn't want to give the conference itself an 
exclusive atmosphere - I still vividly remember my nervousness at my 
first CITCON, trying to overcome the inherent shyness to talk to people,
attempting to join their conversations...</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/capotribu">Marco Abis</a> again, who was
the remote-local organizer of the conference, for making it happen. I 
met wonderful new people, and learned (or refined my understanding) of 
many topics!</p>
<p>During the coming days, I will be adding my session notes to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/">conf wiki</a> coming days, and once I digested all the feedback I 
got during and outside the sessions, I will be writing up the <em>Tree 
Optimized Test Runner</em> and the <em>app-test DSLs to have multiple drivers
for a single TestCase</em> ideas in more detail.</p>
