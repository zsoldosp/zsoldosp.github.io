    <div itemprop="articleBody" class="body">
        <p>In last week's post, I gave a few examples about when <a href="/2013/10/23/a-new-look-at-end-to-end-testing-polymorphic-and-fast/">Polymorphic
End-to-End Testing</a> testing makes sense. In this post, I would
like to take a step back and list a few additional benefits that could
be derived from end to end testing in general, regardless of the fashion
they were written in.</p>
<p><em>Note: some of these points can also apply to non-end-to-end tests too,
that were written in a black box style with proper test abstractions. 
While it could be argued that then the system is that one component, I
would rather just focus on the benefits we can derive on top of the 
regression / specification of the system.</em></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> note this post has been filed under <a href="/category/untested-ideas/">untested ideas</a>
 - they sound good, but I haven't gotten around to implementing all of
them.</p>
<h2 id="big-refactorings-and-rewrites">Big Refactorings and Rewrites</h2>
<p>Change is inevitable, and they often violate previous assumptions. 
Sometimes whole components (or systems) have to be rewritten. Having a 
set of tests that operate on a much higher abstraction level (e.g.: HTTP
GET/POST requests) can provide the required safety net to avoid 
regressions and making sure all relevant scenarios are addressed.</p>
<p>Some changes where this Page (Application) Object abstraction has helped
us:</p>
<ul>
<li>when converting a single page checkout process to a multi-step 
    wizard style checkout</li>
<li>when the article numbers used in our system changed</li>
<li>when we had to synchronize data into a new system - we could just 
    expand our assertions in the end-to-end tests to make sure that 
    every known scenario is written correctly into the new system</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/09/23/Test-first.html">It's easy to reconstruct a system from its tests, but much harder to do
it the other way around</a>. It has been
great to only adjust a few driver API methods and get the same amount of
functional coverage as before, without having to rewrite the test suite.</p>
<h2 id="forces-the-team-to-think-about-the-user-interface-and-experience">Forces the team to think about the user interface (and experience)</h2>
<p>While it is not required, it often made us reduce the complexity in 
the UI - when we find that a certain step is being exercised by a 
method with a single parameter from the tests, yet that method then 
derives a bunch of additional parameters to POST against the page, it
suggests one of two things: </p>
<ol>
<li>we are missing some test cases for these extra parameters</li>
<li>maybe we don't need these parameters to be provided by the end user,
    but we could derive them in the application too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often the helper methods created can expose the need for additional 
support interfaces that won't probably come up during the specifications
phase, only after go-live.  </p>
<p>Last, but not least, end-to-end gives us tests for the UI, yet the tests
remain maintainable - usually a single test API method is all that needs
to be fixed after template changes (and designers are even harder to get
to write tests than developers :)). <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/160929/on-failing-tests">Don't be afraid of many test 
failures!</a></p>
<h2 id="correlate-tests-with-other-business-metrics">Correlate tests with other business metrics</h2>
<p>While I recall people suggesting we run applications with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">coverage 
profiler attached</a>, the performance penalty is usually 
prohibiting.</p>
<p>However, I haven't yet seen a web application without a ton of external
metrics related to the urls in the app. If our tests are written against
urls too, after some data munging (primary keys and actual form values
surely won't match test values exactly, but translating them to <code>GET to 
view 1</code>, <code>POST to view 2</code>) we can correlate our tests with these 
metrics. </p>
<p>Some such metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>application (webserver) access logs</li>
<li>Google Analytics or equivalent</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we learn from these correlations/comparisons?</p>
<ul>
<li>are we concentrating our tests in the least visited areas?</li>
<li>are we testing what our users are doing? Sure, it's nice that in our
    tests people sequentially finish their checkout, without wondering
    off the known path, but is this how they behave in production?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testcase-similarity-analysis">TestCase similarity analysis</h2>
<p>Some test scenarios will come up in multiple aspects of the system. 
Placing an order will trigger a bunch of actions in other modules - 
fulfillment, customer profile updates, marketing classification, invoice
rendering, notification emails, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes these features are added with big time gaps in between, maybe
even the team members have changed over time. The ability to compare 
the requests the different TestCases make, and say that these two 
(three, four, etc.) TestCases seem to execute the same kind of requests
up to a point as the TestCase being added, but they also have the 
following extra paths they all execute, but the new TestCase doesn't...
Causing the developer to realize - of course, there are special rules
for orders from educational institutions!</p>
<h2 id="reducing-the-gap-between-end-user-error-reports-and-tests">Reducing the gap between end user error reports and tests</h2>
<p>Probably this is the least unexpected idea in the list, but worth 
stating nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="in-place-help-for-trusted-users">In place help (for trusted users)</h2>
<p>Sure, this might require careful considerations, but giving the users 
the ability to browse the test cases/methods that matches their workflow
up to the current page, in a searchable fashion (if I place an order 
like this now, when will the X email be sent) could greatly reduce 
support work for the developer team. <em>Note: the purpose of this is not 
to isolate the developers from the users!!!</em></p>
<h2 id="always-up-to-date-screenshots-and-videos">Always up-to-date screenshots and videos</h2>
<p>Those manuals that have screenshots from many releases ago... Adding (or
marking) some test cases to be linked against documentation sections, and
having the tests actually take screenshots about them or record them as 
video sounds like a pretty useful idea for me. One could go further, 
such as highlighting the values/input fields where the test sends 
input, and the parts of the page that are asserted against...</p>
<p>And if the support team has access to the same API, they could even 
create these screenshots/videos for the customer as they are answering
their question (Here, take a look at this video, this is how the thing
you asked for is done).</p>
<hr />
<p>There must be many more ideas out there - let me know about them, and 
I'm happy to add them to this list (or link to wherever you published
it)!</p>
