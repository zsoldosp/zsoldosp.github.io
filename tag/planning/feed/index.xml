      <description>T-1 - or a recap of the trip preparations</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<p>It's been a busy few weeks. To recap my preparations:</p>
<p><h2>I've got a new tent</h2></p>
<p>We have just recently moved to Germany, so still a lot of things are still in Hungary. None of my potential cycling friends could join me for this trip, so the plan that they'll bring my small tent here is not an option. The tent we have here is for 3-3.5 people and has a huge front - and weighs accordingly. After it turned out how horribly expensive it is to send a tent by mail, we've gone shopping and got a medium, 2 person tent (Gelert Eiger 2) for a few euros more than what the postal costs would have been. I'm a bit nervous as always with new, untried (under real conditions) equipment, but the brand's similar solo tent got generally gets good reviews and there were no visible holes when we pitched it in the flat.</p>
<p><h2>I'm still using my dad's old pannier bags</h2>
<div class="caption">It's surprisingly stable! <img alt="The bike loaded with the bag for the test ride" class="size-medium wp-image-29" height="225" src="/2012/04/x-001.jpg?w=300" title="All my bags are packed and I'm ready to go" width="300"/></div></p>
<p>It's not pretty, not waterproof, and is a bit fiddly to install. However, even though it's a three compartment model, it weighs only around 0.7kgs. And its durable, we have already used it on our prior trips and it holds up. I'm dreading the day it stops working, since a quick online search shows all available bags are *heavy*...</p>
<p><h2>Took the bike with full luggage for a test ride</h2></p>
<p>I actually planned a Crailsheim-Nürnberg trip, but had to give up after 20kms - the bowden coating and the bowden was torn and I couldn't shift gears anymore. I was stuck in steep mountain gear - on flat terrain. Max speed: 13km/h. But then my cadence was already in the sky!</p>
<p>I also got a flat tire reminding me that I've been meaning to replace the old rear one, but never got around to it. Since I'm lazy, I just bought a new one, planning to bring that along and mount it after the next flat. But the next flat came vefore the start, just finished replacing it. Friday the 13th :)</p>
<p><div class="caption">Actually it's easier to remove and reinstall the wheel with the pannier bags providing support so the frame is in the air for easy access with the wrench <img alt="the lying bike with the fixed back wheel not yet replaced" class="size-medium wp-image-28" height="225" src="/2012/04/x-002.jpg?w=300" title="Flat tire" width="300"/></div></p>
<p>Back to the trip/bike - it felt more stable than when i was touring with the Neuzer Courier DT. However, speed - even when I had multiple available gears - is less than what I'm used to. The extra circa 13kg could do that I guess, not mentioning the extra air resistance. But the riding still feels fun and I still could overtake people :)</p>
<p><h2>Got some spare parts</h2></p>
<p>Though I am not a bicycle mechanic, after having been burnt by the irregular stem screws (why couldn't Dahon use a standard sized one, available in any shop is still a mystery to me), I asked my local dealers for spikes (of course front and rear are of different length) and stem screw. At least I can give them to any mechanic if needed.</p>
<p><h2>Got a bicycle computer</h2></p>
<p>Sigma 1009. The phone gps/software can be unreliable, and I am a data junkie - not knowing how far/fast I traveled would disturb me. I would love to get something like the Rox 9.1, which enables detailed analysis, but I can't justify the cost, especially with the potential purchase of a inflatable canoe on the horizon. Slight problem with this one is that I only got around installing it today, and - Friday 13th again - it doesn't work. Maybe too wide a fork? Will check tomorrow morning with the bikeshop.</p>
<p><h2>Gadgets</h2></p>
<p>Not much :) I'll take my smartphone with a spare battery with me (plus a backup dumbphone which goes for weeks with one charge :), that should last for a full day, even with continouous gps recording.</p>
<p>I'll see whether I can get an austrian SIM near Passau, if not, roaming with a special package will be the alternative. But I hope I get a SIM.</p>
<p><h2>Camping pre-checks</h2></p>
<p>First I thought it's an overkill, but since we've run into problems in France ("sorry, this camping is only for Caravans"), I wanted to be sure. I knew the Austrian part is no problem, but the German ones I knew nothing about. Searching google maps alone is not enough, some campings don't say they are a camping on their website (read through as many trip blogs as you can for these!), and most places respond to emails within a day. And I've learned of some closed ones, or ones that don't open till May, so I think it was worth it.</p>
<p>I'm bringing along a printed address/phone list. I love modern technology, but some things I don't want to risk not having access to :)</p>
<p><h2>Food</h2></p>
<p>I was considering getting a stove, but the experiment is delayed, and I'll stick to restaurants/pizzas/döner&amp;co for the evening. Butterbrazel for breakfast, and the fruits &amp; power bar likes for the day. Or whatever the Imbisses/Biergartens will have on the way.</p>
<p><h2>Finally, picked a route</h2></p>
<p>After a lot of research, I finally decided that I don't want to start the tour by going from 300m to above 1000 in the first day, so the Bodensee will have to wait - messing up bad knees on day one don't seem fun. So it will be Crailsheim - Dinkelsbühl, the the Romantische Strasse to Donauwörth, and from there it's the Donauradweg all the way to Budapest. Given I was unable to complete the longer test trip, I have no clue how much I can cover in a day, so we'll see. But I still think the 140ish km/day is still realistic, and since I am leaving tomorrow after my girlfriend took the train, I have an extra half day for Havarias.</p>
<p>Now to sleep!</p>

      <description>Route planning</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<p>What better to do while lying in the bed with the flu than to plan the actual route?</p>
<p>It is a bit more challenging than just saying, well <a href="http://cambridgetochristchurch.wordpress.com/2010/05/18/day-13-crailsheim-to-donauwoerth/">Crailsheim - Donauwörth</a>  and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason I can actually cycle home is that my girlfriend is taking a course in <a href="http://langenargen.de/">Langenargen</a> for a week. However, since we don't have a car, it's impossible for her to get there in time for the start of her course on Sunday, so she must go there the previous day. So going there together for a Saturday seems like a great idea - if the route from there is still doable within the time constraints (I have 8 days to get to Budapest). Based on a quick <a href="https://maps.google.com/">google maps</a> search it seemed so, so I went into the details (elevation is not such a big issue when driving a car, but for cycling with bad knees it certainly is).
<h2>Finding cycling routes in Germany online</h2>
<strong>Radweg</strong> is the keyword to search for. Finding routes today is much easier - there is so much available content blogged (<a href="http://radreiseberichte.npage.de/bodensee-koenigssee-radweg.html">trip reports</a>, and <a href="http://www.threehundredsixtydegree.de/rundtour-muenchen-bodensee-konigssee-muenchen/">more trip reports</a>) and shared via fitness tracking sites(<a href="http://runkeeper.com">RunKeeper</a>, <a href="http://everytrail.com">EveryTrail</a>, <a href="http://endomondo.com">Endomondo</a>). I have to say though that the route tracking sites are somewhat hard to use for long routes, so if I haven't found the 360 degree blog, I might not have been able to find their routes as one that might interest me. Also, until I knew the actual route's name, it was somewhat difficult to search for it :) The find the name of the route - <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r132.htm">fahrradreisen.de</a> was a great help there, and it has rough map sketches at the bottom, just above the ads. And <a href="http://translate.google.com/">google translate</a> can make a world of a difference (though I was pleasantly surprised I didn't need it all the time - I must actually been learning some German, not just trying to!) And then there is <a href="http://www.naviki.org/">naviki</a>, which ties together user's uploaded tracks, creating an incredibly full coverage for German cycling routes. Or routes people cycle on :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naviki.org/">naviki</a> is great, but has a few limitations (hey, it's beta!)
<ul>
<li>it doesn't know about "official" routes, so it will always give you the shortest route between two points - even if there is a mountain to cross, which could have been avoided by making a small detour. But you can provide intermediate points, just like with google maps to guide it to your desire</li>
<li>when you misspell or don't give the precise name for a town (e.g.: Wernstein vs. "Wernstein am Inn"), it hangs, and you have to reload the site, and start reentering *all* the data - previously entered location names are forgotten (and it doesn't trigger the browser's autocomplete feature)</li>
<li>you can only have 19 points specified (and sometimes less - no clue why)</li>
</ul>
<div>But these are minor things. And putting up with these does totally worth it, because</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>it gives you the elevation profile</li>
<li>and you can download the whole route in many file formats (I prefer GPX)</li>
</ul>
<div>I worked around the 19 point limitation by uploading the naviki exported files to Everytrail into a <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=1501308">single trip</a> (create the first one, then edit waypoints, +upload more gps file and it adds the points to the existing route).</div>
<div></div>
<div>So now I have a single view for my route options (included at the end of the post)</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Route options</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cambridgetochristchurch.wordpress.com/2010/05/18/day-13-crailsheim-to-donauwoerth/">Crailsheim - Donauwörth</a>  and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a></li>
<li>Langenargen - <a href="http://www.bodensee-koenigssee-radweg.de/">Bodensee-Konigsweg-Radweg</a>; <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r134.htm">Isar-Radweg</a>; and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.threehundredsixtydegree.de/rundtour-muenchen-bodensee-konigssee-muenchen/">Langenargen - Munchen</a>; <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r134.htm">Isar-Radweg</a>; and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a></li>
<li>Langenargen - <a href="http://www.bodensee-koenigssee-radweg.de/">Bodensee-Konigsweg-Radweg</a>; <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r18.htm">Inntal-Radweg</a></li>
</ul>
<div>And of course, from Passau to Budapest it's the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Dona Radweg</a>.</div>
<h2>So which path will I follow?</h2>
<div>Don't know yet :)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm usually not the type to cycle uphill (bad knees), and thus I'm somewhat worried about the steep ascents in the <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r132.htm">Bodensee-Konigsee-Radweg</a> on my first day, but since it's only two real steep one, in the worst case I can just walk up with the bike and plan for a real short first day (it's downhill almost all the way from there, so I should be able to push those lost kilometers into the following seven days). And I have never yet been above 1000 meters with a bike, and it's tempting. Though from the two valleys (Isar/Inn) I'll probably choose the Inn, since I won't have much time to do sightseeing, and cycling near big cities is usually not pretty and fun - great for training/commuting, but not for a trip.</div>
</div>
<a href="https://twitter.com/360degreede">360degree</a>'s path is shorter and has less of a killer ascent in the beginning, but I'm not sure if it goes on dedicated cycling roads or it's just together with the cars - some of the roads it goes along seem to be main roads from the map.
