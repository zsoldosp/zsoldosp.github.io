      <description>Facilitating the Global Day of Coderetreat Zagreb (and a little Nuremberg) 2015</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>This was the second Zagreb <a href="http://coderetreat.org">coderetreat</a>, and this year we actually managed to
organize it to take place the same day as the rest of the world :) Thanks to 
the sponsors <a href="http://toptal.com">Toptal</a>, <a href="http://goodcode.io">Good Code</a>, <a href="http://floatingpoint.io">Floating Point</a> and
the hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin">Zeljko</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maljosa">Aljosa</a> for making it happen!</p>
<p><img alt="the team working on the game of life" src="/img/gdcr2015zag/whole-team.jpg" /></p>
<p>Due to our last minute advertising, the participants were Ruby heavy, but 
still, the eight people coded in Ruby, Python, C#, Haskell, JavaScript, and
R throughout the day - quite a feat if you consider that two attendees were 
not professional programmers!</p>
<p>Due to a late start and time constraint we only had 5 sessions with the
following constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>no extra constraints, just exploring pairing, TDD, 4 rules of simple design,
    and the game of life</li>
<li>evil ping pong pairing</li>
<li>void methods only + remote pairing with Nuremberg (Germany)</li>
<li>maximum 3 lines per method</li>
<li>no conditionals (later restricted to no booleans)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="remote-pairing-with-nuremberg">Remote pairing with Nuremberg</h1>
<p><img alt="remote pairing from zagreb" src="/img/gdcr2015zag/remote02.jpg" /></p>
<p>As I've known <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoemmrich">Marco</a> from before, a few days before the GDCR we had 
a video call where we tested out the feasibility  of remote pairing (we've
tried <a href="http://tmate.io">tmate.io</a> and <a href="http://floobits.com">FlooBits</a>), and
deemed it feasible for a coderetreat (i.e.: can be set up during the lunchbreak).</p>
<p><em>Aside</em>: Planning is everything, but no plan survives first contact with 
the enemy. All pairs used <a href="http://teamviewer.com">TeamViewer</a>
and VisualStudio in the end.</p>
<p>We used the lunchbreak to pair people up using a direct videocall between
me and <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoemmrich">Marco</a>, but that is a cumbersome process and we'll try to
come up with a better one for next time (maybe use a Google spreadsheet
where each location can put down the interested parties' language, tooling
and communication preferences before?), but nonetheless all remote pairs 
reported having had fun!</p>
<p>Facilitating remote pairs is surprisingly easy, but only when the pairs use
the headphones which can be shared between two people - one bud in each person's
ear.</p>
<p>While it does require some prior coordination between the hosts (sync session 
start times, agree on the same constraint for the session, etc.), I do suggest
you try it out if you have the chance, especially if you haven't remote paired
before!</p>

      <description>Podcasts I Listen To</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>Initially I started listening to podcasts to keep up with news in
the software development space, but it has expanded way beyond that.
Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin/status/444052979172507648">Zeljko has asked for podcast recommendations</a>,
so instead of shooting a private email I thought I would share the
casts I listen to publicly in a post.</p>
<p>Note it's a <em>long</em> list - but I don't hesitate to skip/delete an episode
based on its description or its first few minutes (caveat: some casts
by their structure are less exciting in the first few minutes).</p>
<p>I've grouped the list, but of course there are many of them that would
fit multiple categories - no taxonomy ever is perfect.</p>
<p>Hope you find something you'll like!</p>
<h2 id="software-development">Software Development</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/">.NET Rocks</a> was one of the first podcasts I've listened to. As the
  name suggests, it's focused on the Microsoft development space, but the hosts
  are critical enough when needed, and many episodes are tech agnostic. Disclaimer:
  I'm a happy owner of a .NET Rocks mug</li>
<li><a href="http://thetabletshow.com/">The Tablet Show</a> - the sister show to .NET Rocks, with focus on mobile
  and tablets. The Microsoft focus doesn't come through that heavily
  (though it's there)</li>
<li><a href="http://devopscafe.org/">DevOps Cafe</a> - there are some great interviews on here, though the format 
  (sound quality?) took me some getting used to. It exposes me to topics I'm
  a total n00b about, whether its security or networking.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a> - Scott started this with the tagline "the podcast that doesn't
  waste your time". The episodes are limited to around half an hour, and while
  the topics stay around tech, they also touch on the social/human side, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott interviewing his wife about how it is to live with a geek</li>
<li>interviews with developers from publicly underrepresented developer
  groups (women, world class climbers, you name it :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://rubyrouges.com/">Ruby Rogues</a> - a panel discussion about things Ruby related, but many of
  the discussions are applicable to other programming languages, or at the very
  least inspire one to learn how the thing discussed works in the listener's 
  language. Add on top of this they bring up cultural topics that should be
  discussed in the software development community.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://javaposse.com/">The Java Posse</a> - it used to be a mix of panel discussion of java/scala programmers,
  and recordings of sessions from the yearly open spaces conferences of 
  the same name, but lately it's just the conference stuff. So great for learning, but
  I miss the chat shows.</li>
<li><a href="http://theshipshow.com/">The Ship Show</a> - build and release engineering, devops, and everything else in 
  between. Panel discussions, news and views, listener questions, as well as 
  interviews. It definitely fills a niche.</li>
<li><a href="http://cognitect.com/podcast">ThinkRelevance/CogniCast</a> - anything and everything related to Clojure or Datomic,
  produced professionally by the company where Rich Hickey works. Sometimes 
  it's too Clojure heavy for me (though you might find that a good thing), but it
  has blown my mind a few times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pop-science">(Pop-)Science</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00srz5b">A Brief History of Mathematics</a> - a former BBC Radio4 programme archived in podcast
  form. Short episodes on the various influential people in mathematics. I'm planning
  to re-listen to this series soon.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd">More or Less</a> - Statistical CSI :) Produced by (among others) Tim Harford, 
  this show takes a look at public statistical claims from any aspect of life, 
  and go after digging up sources for these claims as well as verifying them
  and the methodology used. Listener topic suggestions are encouraged!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127413729">NPR Planet Money</a> - Awesome economics podcast, with short and entertaining 
  episodes. They have provided the best economics coverage of the EU debt crisis
  for laymen like me.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="social-politics">Social, Politics</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/analysis">Analysis</a> - another BBC Radio 4 programme. Each episode presents one person's
  research and conclusion/opinion of a given topic. Expect lot of source 
  interviews.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b010q0n0">Four Thought</a> - personal speeches about personal experiences, delivered to a live
  audience, followed by a few questions and answers. It keeps reminding me how
  little I know about the world and people.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qk11">Moral Maze</a> - a panel hearing out witnesses on moral questions, arguing with
  the witnesses and with themselves, exploring different these difficult topics, which
  usually don't have clearcut answers. Great topics, great points, and some
  heated debate.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.npr.org/series/6263392/intelligence-squared-u-s">Intelligence Squared</a> - recording of live, superbly moderated debates, published
  as podcasts. The structure (uninterrupted opening statements, Q &amp; A, uninterrupted 
  closing statements, voting) is wonderful, and the moderator is on top of his game. The
  topics are timely and interesting, the debaters are amazingly authentic, and the
  voting results do show that people can change their minds.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.onbeing.org/">On Being with Krista Tippett</a> - exploring open and tolerant faith. Whether by interviewing
  atheists, the translator of the Dalai Lama, a marine biologist, civil right movement
  participants, or marketing guru Seth Godin. Superb audio quality and Krista does have
  a voice which in itself makes it worth listening to any episode - not to mention the
  positive thinking that radiates from the talks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy05">Thinking Allowed</a> - short BBC Radio4 programme reporting on recent papers or books
  in the field of sociology on various subjects.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="outdoors">Outdoors</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theoutdoorsstation.co.uk/">The Outdoors Station</a> - an irregular podcast. I tend to skip the product episodes,
  and prefer the interview ones. While irregular, the archive does hold quite a 
  few gems - if you are into outdoor stories.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="business-chatting">Business, chatting</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/">Startups for the Rest Of Us</a> - if you ever wanted to understand how small software business 
  owners and marketers think, and need an occasional reminder that we as software
  people are there to deliver solutions, not to write software, it's a great one. On
  top of this, there is a bunch of practical advice if you are trying yourself out 
  in internet marketing. And you can follow Mike and Rob as they develop their respective
  businesses</li>
<li><a href="http://techzinglive.com/">techzing</a> - while lately it has become more of a weekly recorded talk of two friends, 
  which presents new listeners with a steep learning curve during the first few episodes,
  in the past they had wonderful interviews - and even now their hobbies are exciting
  and inspiring enough to listen to (have you ever considered coaching your children's
  school's math team? They actually do that).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://manager-tools.com/">Career tools, Manager Tools</a> - I would say this is mandatory listening to anyone who
  wants to make progress in an enterprise environment. Especially if you want to 
  become an executive. Their advice is quite prescriptive (they are ex-military after
  all), but they present their reasoning in (sometimes too) much detail. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/category/podcasts/">Kalzumeus Software</a> - the once-in-a-rare-while podcast of Patrick McKenzie (a.k.a.: patio11).
  There is everything from living in Japan to superb advice to furthering your career,
  especially if you are a freelancer. Since there aren't too many episodes, you can go back 
  and listen to all of them!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reference">Reference</h2>
<p>These casts I don't regularly listen to anymore, but have them
bookmarked in case I would want to dive deeper in the topics they
address, for the episodes I've listened to convinced me of its
quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://beingtheworst.com/">Being the Worst</a> - for event sourcing and Domain Driven Design</li>
<li><a href="http://marketingforfounders.com/">Marketing for Founders</a> - Feels like marketing 10x-20x lectures.
  Not super exciting to listen to if you don't do this, but probably
  superb to pick up the basic ideas fast.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-the-best-podcasts-theme-music-award-goes-to">And the Best Podcasts Theme Music Award Goes To...</h2>
<p>Hard to tell. Obviously, the Cognicast has the advantage that guests 
choose their own intro and exit music... So I have to disqualify it :)
From the rest, I can narrow it down to the Ruby Rogues and The Ship Show,
but not any further...</p>

      <description>Adding New Quality Checks to the Build</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p><small><strong>update</strong> (2014-03-08): added reference to podcast time segments
and clarified ambiguity </small></p>
<p>I just got around to listening to <a href="http://theshipshow.com/2014/02/scaling-your-self-service-as-a-service/">The Ship Show #37</a>, and
one of the topics they've discussed (47:00-48:00, 49:30-50:00) was
adding new quality checks to the build. Or to be more precise, they've
<strike>discussed</strike> talked about a case which exhibits the
anti-pattern way of adding new checks to the build, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a new quality check (e.g.: let's not have compiler warnings)</li>
<li>Get team buy in </li>
<li>Modify the build to fail on these violations</li>
<li>Have a broken build for the coming months - and have developers
   ignore <strong>real</strong> build failures (<em>ah, it's broken only due to the new
   checks!</em>)</li>
<li>Abandon this new quality check so that a failed build actually
   means the build is actually broken</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to avoid the above scenario is to focus on gradual improvement,
i.e.: after steps #1 and #2 (which shouldn't be skipped!), in step #3, 
instead of a <em>zero-tolerance</em> policy, you <strong>set the limit for the new check 
violations at the current level</strong> - i.e.: the team commits to not making the
situation any worse, and trying to improve it. Exceeding this limit will 
make the build fail, and thus there are no more false alarms - all build 
failures have to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>If your monitoring/build tool doesn't support "continuously decreasing limits"
out of the box, you'll have to adjust this limit manually, let's say every morning.
Be careful to only ever <em>lower</em> the limit though!</p>
<p>And there are other <a href="/2014/01/19/green-build-surprises/">things you should be monitoring about your build</a>
too!</p>

      <description>Unit Testing In Elixir</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <div class="document">
<p><em>Note that all of this was written at the time of Elixir
0.12.5-dev, so things might have changed since.</em></p>
<p>Since the <a class="reference external" href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/ex_unit/1.html">tutorial</a>
covers the mechanics pretty well, this post is more about my
impressions of Elixir's approach to this topic.</p>
<div class="section" id="built-in">
<h1>Built-in</h1>
<p>Unit testing is built into the language and the tools, as well as the
tutorial - I love this approach. When you create a new project with
<tt class="docutils literal">mix</tt>, this is the output you get:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
<span class="nv">$ </span>mix new myproject
...
Your mix project was created successfully.
You can use mix to compile it, <span class="nb">test </span>it, and more:

    <span class="nb">cd </span>myproject
    mix compile
    mix <span class="nb">test

</span>Run <span class="sb">`</span>mix <span class="nb">help</span><span class="sb">`</span> <span class="k">for </span>more information.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-test-skeleton-is-not-beginner-friendly">
<h1>The test skeleton is not beginner friendly</h1>
<p>The skeleton unit test suffers the same problems like the <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>
equivalent - it is aimed at those who get unit testing already. If you
are new to automated testing, seeing code like</p>
<pre class="code elixir literal-block">
<span class="k">defmodule</span> <span class="no">FooTest</span> <span class="k">do
  </span><span class="kn">use</span> <span class="no">ExUnit</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Case</span>

  <span class="n">test</span> <span class="s2">&quot;the truth&quot;</span> <span class="k">do
    </span><span class="n">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre>
<p>won't really make you say <em>&quot;yes, this makes me understand and love testing!&quot;</em>.
Granted, the whole Elixir tutorial is aimed at people who can already
program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="simplified-yet-flexible-assertions">
<h1>Simplified, yet flexible assertions</h1>
<p>Unlike classic unit testing frameworks, which come bundled with
numerous <tt class="docutils literal">assertWhatever</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">assertNotWhatever</tt> etc. methods,
(various overloads for each type), ExUnit mostly only uses <tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">assert_raise</tt> (though there are some more - see
<a class="reference external" href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/ExUnit.Assertions.html">ExUnit.Assertions</a>).
Rather, it relies on pattern matching and the assert macro being
smart enough to figure out how to provide a good (enough) failure
message - in this aspect, it reminds me of <a class="reference external" href="http://pytest.org/latest/">py.test</a></p>
<p>I'm curious to see whether it will stay this way - custom assertions
are superb for writing DSL-like code that experts can read (e.g.:
<a class="reference external" href="http://hamcrest.org/">Hamcrest</a>), and I really like the protocol-based extensibility
model used in Elixir elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constraint-of-the-failure-messages">
<h1>Constraint of the failure messages</h1>
<p>Your opinion of this feature might differ from mine, but it's worth
pointing this out. While the assertions are pretty flexible,
the actual error message will become the <strong>values</strong> on the left- and right
hand side of the pattern matching. This takes away the information of
exactly which method was called with what parameters, which
I have grown to rely on in Python. Consider the following tests and
the resulting failure messages - which one is more helpful?</p>

<p>Granted, Python is unique in this regard, IIRC I wouldn't get such
useful stacktraces in C# or Java either, but since I've been mostly
working in Python lately, it certainly was a surprise - not necessarily
for discouraging multiple assertions per test (it's a valid approach),
but more the hiding of the call site information.</p>
<p>However, since <tt class="docutils literal">assert</tt> itself is a macro, its technically possible
to change the assertion - added to my list of things to try :)</p>

<div class="section" id="async">
<h1>:async</h1>
<p>Test isolation is almost always hard, and these issues tend to only come
out from hiding once tests need to run in parallel for speed - good things
never come alone :) So having concurrent test running built in from the
start is a great way to have the one big (future) problem broken into
many minor inconveniences.</p>
<p>I also like that instead of a test runner command line switch, it is
declared on the TestCase level whether it's OK to run it in parallel
- giving finer control to the test author.</p>

<p>Abstract concepts are always easier to learn with concrete examples.
This is the first code-heavy post in the series, and it is intended to
illustrate the mechanics of the concept, not yet how it is applied to
the problem domain. For this reason, I use the example of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
Numbers</a>, with a naive
implementation - the business logic is not the emphasis here, but how we
test them on multiple levels.</p>
<p>I chose <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> to write the code,
in because of its lovely built in end-to-end testing support, but
knowing that not everyone is a Django developer (yet!), I chose <em>not</em>
to use any of the more idiomatic <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/class-based-views/">Django class based views</a>,
since the purpose of this post is not to teach idiomatic Django.</p>
<p>Enough of the disclaimers, on to the code!</p>

<p>As you can see, on top of the assertions in the base class, I've added
a few additional assertions, for the api contract (invariants) - this
api shouldn't return extra fields, or if it does, I should be notified
and then decided whether that's a bug that needs correction or a feature,
in which case I'll adjust the <strong>allowed_keys</strong> variable</p>
<p>And here is the implementation:</p>

<h1>Let's expose this feature to normal user as HTML!</h1>
<p>The order of the events is sometimes the other way around, but sooner
or later the point comes when the same functionality must be exposed
through a different channel - whether it's a simplified/more efficient
power user interface for your internal support people as opposed to
your first time customers through the public web shop, or adding a
mobile app for your web service, it will happen. And it's nice to know
we can execute the same set of tests against all implementations.</p>

to the incorrect mental model I had about <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_overloading">method overloading</a>

<h1>My wrong mental model</h1>
<p>I was thinking that since in interviews, tutorials, etc. method
overloading always comes up, there must be something special about it.
It makes for dynamic dispatch - which gets bound at compile time in
regular Java, but when invoked dynamically, it will resolve to the
appropriate overload. I.e.: the following pseudocode would be valid:</p>
<pre class="code elixir literal-block">
<span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">MethodOverloadingArity</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot; - &quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>You can tell just from the heading that of course, it's is not valid.
And this is what we get from Elixir:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
** (UndefinedFunctionError) undefined function: MethodOverloadingArity.join/0
    MethodOverloadingArity.join()
    MethodOverloadingArity.exs:13: (file)
    (elixir) src/elixir_lexical.erl:17: :elixir_lexical.run/2
    (elixir) lib/code.ex:301: Code.require_file/2


</pre>
<p>In the language, the functions are only unique with the combination of
the function name and the number of arguments - it fails because it
cannot find an overload which takes 0 arguments. Thus at the time I
store a reference to it in a variable, I have to resolve the arity.</p>
<p>Initially I thought it's just a special behavior for Elixir (Erlang),
so I set out to explore how it works in Java</p>
<pre class="code java literal-block">

<p>(<em>Yes, it reminds me how much more elegant metaprogramming is in Python.
But Python has no method overloading</em>)</p>
<p>To my surprise (though in retrospect, it's obvious), arity also plays a
role in identifying methods in Java - notice how there are two methods
returned:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
public static java.lang.String MethodOverloadingArity.join(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)
... invocation result (2 args): first second
... (3 args) java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: wrong number of arguments
public static java.lang.String MethodOverloadingArity.join(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)
... (2 args) java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: wrong number of arguments
... invocation result (3 args): first - second

</pre>
<p>So in Java function overloading works the exact same way as it does in
Elixir (and based on my quick hallway research, in most other languages)
- an actual method is only identified by its name and arity (and in typed
languages, by type). Thus there is no dynamic method invocation based on
just its name.</p>
<p>So method overloading is just a convention, or if you wish to call it, a
hack.  I wish I learned of name and arity instead of method overloading
first!</p>
<p><em>This is yet another example why learning other languages benefits you even
if you won't end up using the new language in your day job!</em></p>
<p>With regardso to using method overloading, I think I prefer the Ruby/Python
approach - one name, one function, period. For most usecases, default argument
values allow for enough flexibility, and prevent abuse of this convention
(giving two wildly different implementations for the various overloads).</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: of course, I might still be entirely wrong. If so, please let
me know!</p>
<p>Also, I would like to thank <em>chrismccord</em>, <em>josevalim</em>, and <em>ericmj</em> from
the <cite>#elixir-lang</cite> IRC channel for patiently putting up with me and
helping me understand all this.</p>

      <description>Why I chose Elixir to learn this year (and initial impressions)</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>Because I liked the color. Just kidding - but I didn't invest too much
time into making the choice - though I'm sure that all the things I read
or heard during this past year influenced me.</p>
<p>It quickly boiled down to <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> or <a href="http://www.elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a></p>
<p>Elixir won because:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/hht9s6nAAx8">Prag Dave recommends it</a></li>
<li>I wanted to finally follow through on a functional language (
  I've played with <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a> before, but
  somehow I didn't fall in love)</li>
<li>For one reason or another I never got excited about <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, 
  but people keep telling me how nice its syntax is, and Elixir's
  is inspired by Ruby's, so I should get a taste. And semicolons are
  not required!</li>
<li>it's running on the Erlang VM, which seems to be quite different
  from the things I've used in the past</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>
<p>So far, I haven't yet finished the second page of the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html">tutorial</a>,
have solved the first few <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Euler problems</a>, subscribed to the 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/elixir-lang-talk">elixir-talk</a> mailing list, and have asked for help on the IRC
channel. So I'm quite at the beginning.</p>
<p>Some of the things that were a "culture shock" or at least 
unexpected/confusing for me were:</p>
<ul>
<li>To quit the REPL (<code>iex</code>), one has to do <code>CTRL-C</code>. Not <code>CTRL-D</code>, 
   or type exit. Since at first I didn't read the startup message,
   I had the "get me out of here" desperation first time <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
   users are famous for.</li>
<li>Different types require different pattern matching - 
  <code>{head | tail } = {1, 2, 3}</code> does not work, it only works on lists
  <code>[head | tail ] = [1, 2, 3]</code>.</li>
<li>Operators that should be the same are not. For concatenating strings,
   you use <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, but for joining two lists, you use <code>++</code>. My python
   roots rebel - even if this likely provides helpful type
   hints once I'm familiar with it</li>
<li>Strong (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>) and weak (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>!</code>)
   boolean comparisons. I'm quite afraid of the mistakes I'll go,
   not realizing whether I check for strict boolean values or just 
   against <code>nil/false</code>. Scary...</li>
<li>Unlike in Python, the REPL (<code>iex</code>) and the script executor (<code>elixir</code>)
   are two separate commands.</li>
<li>There are no semicolons alright, but there are too many <code>end</code>s required
   for my taste. Python did spoil me in this aspect...</li>
<li>Blocks need to be parenthesized properly otherwise some nasty surprises
   happen, e.g.: <code>is_number if true do 1 + 2 end</code> is parsed as
   <code>is_number(if true) do 1 + 2 end</code></li>
<li>Pattern matching is powerful on one hand, but quite limited in others.
   Probably once I understand how it works, I won't try to do things like<br>
   <code>a = 1</code><br>
   <code>(^a + 1) = 2</code><br> as match. Though I'm still curious why
   <code>^a = (2 - 1)</code> works</li>
<li>Guard clauses - probably the list of what you can and cannot do is due
   to some Erlang VM internals, but I dislike memorizing things...</li>
<li>Maybe it's too early for me to read <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0123-dev">release notes</a> - reading
   "The list <code>[1, 2, three: :four]</code> now correctly expands to 
   <code>[1, 2, {:three, :four}]</code>" makes me feel again that I have to be super
   careful when reading code...</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are really nice and fun moments, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installation was easy - thanks to <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/07/05/installing-elixir-on-ubuntu-13-04/">Avdi Grim's post</a>.</li>
<li>I was able to quickly understand the structure of the exceptions -
   the &lt;function name&gt;/&lt;N&gt; refers to the number of arguments
   of the function.</li>
<li>Nice utf support - though since all strings are bytes, I have to keep
   this in mind for pattern matching - <code>&lt;&lt;f, rest :: binary&gt;&gt;</code> matches
   differently from <code>&lt;&lt;f :: utf8, rest :: binary &gt;&gt;</code>. So maybe this belongs
   to the above list :)</li>
<li>I love how anonymous functions can be turned into full blocks, unlike in
   Python.</li>
<li><code>fib = Stream.unfold({0, 1}, fn {a, b} -&gt; {a, {b, a + b}} end)</code></li>
<li><code>#elixirlang</code> on freenode is great and super helpful</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>
<p>"It's your foot". But I'll keep with learning the language, for I know a ton 
of people who can't imagine writing maintainable programs without static type
checking, yet I know it's possible. Back in the days of <a href="http://thatextramile.be/blog/2010/01/as-a-movement-alt-net-has-been-dead-for-a-while">Alt.NET</a>,
the motto was that we are adults, so we can use knives and scissors...</p>

      <description>Green Build Surprises</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>Recently while working on our build process, I ran into an unexpected
surprise - the build server reported no error (i.e.: it was displaying a
green status, since all tests were passing), yet there was a major issue
- not all of our tests were run!</p>
<p>Given that the situation was caused by working on the build itself, the
issue was discovered in time (<strike>though somewhat accidentally</strike>
during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">exploratory testing</a>). However, this was a
nice reminder of the problem with the "unknown unknowns" - now that we
know of this issue, of course we have configured alerting for the case
when the current build ran less tests than the build before. But I
wonder how many times we may have released on a green build with
regression bugs...</p>
<p>Asking some others and looking back on my past experiences, this topic
hasn't come up, so while I hope it is obvious and not news for you, dear
reader, I blog it just in case I wasn't the last to get the memo...</p>
<p>And it turns out that every now and then we do mess up and commit code
that makes some tests invisible to the test runner... So it wasn't just
a one-off thing!</p>

      <description>Going Beyond Regression - What Other Benefits could End-to-End Testing Provide?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>In last week's post, I gave a few examples about when <a href="/2013/10/23/a-new-look-at-end-to-end-testing-polymorphic-and-fast/">Polymorphic
End-to-End Testing</a> testing makes sense. In this post, I would
like to take a step back and list a few additional benefits that could
be derived from end to end testing in general, regardless of the fashion
they were written in.</p>
<p><em>Note: some of these points can also apply to non-end-to-end tests too,
that were written in a black box style with proper test abstractions. 
While it could be argued that then the system is that one component, I
would rather just focus on the benefits we can derive on top of the 
regression / specification of the system.</em></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> note this post has been filed under <a href="/category/untested-ideas/">untested ideas</a>
 - they sound good, but I haven't gotten around to implementing all of
them.</p>
<h2 id="big-refactorings-and-rewrites">Big Refactorings and Rewrites</h2>
<p>Change is inevitable, and they often violate previous assumptions. 
Sometimes whole components (or systems) have to be rewritten. Having a 
set of tests that operate on a much higher abstraction level (e.g.: HTTP
GET/POST requests) can provide the required safety net to avoid 
regressions and making sure all relevant scenarios are addressed.</p>
<p>Some changes where this Page (Application) Object abstraction has helped
us:</p>
<ul>
<li>when converting a single page checkout process to a multi-step 
    wizard style checkout</li>
<li>when the article numbers used in our system changed</li>
<li>when we had to synchronize data into a new system - we could just 
    expand our assertions in the end-to-end tests to make sure that 
    every known scenario is written correctly into the new system</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/09/23/Test-first.html">It's easy to reconstruct a system from its tests, but much harder to do
it the other way around</a>. It has been
great to only adjust a few driver API methods and get the same amount of
functional coverage as before, without having to rewrite the test suite.</p>
<h2 id="forces-the-team-to-think-about-the-user-interface-and-experience">Forces the team to think about the user interface (and experience)</h2>
<p>While it is not required, it often made us reduce the complexity in 
the UI - when we find that a certain step is being exercised by a 
method with a single parameter from the tests, yet that method then 
derives a bunch of additional parameters to POST against the page, it
suggests one of two things: </p>
<ol>
<li>we are missing some test cases for these extra parameters</li>
<li>maybe we don't need these parameters to be provided by the end user,
    but we could derive them in the application too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often the helper methods created can expose the need for additional 
support interfaces that won't probably come up during the specifications
phase, only after go-live.<br />
</p>
<p>Last, but not least, end-to-end gives us tests for the UI, yet the tests
remain maintainable - usually a single test API method is all that needs
to be fixed after template changes (and designers are even harder to get
to write tests than developers :)). <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/160929/on-failing-tests">Don't be afraid of many test 
failures!</a></p>
<h2 id="correlate-tests-with-other-business-metrics">Correlate tests with other business metrics</h2>
<p>While I recall people suggesting we run applications with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">coverage 
profiler attached</a>, the performance penalty is usually 
prohibiting.</p>
<p>However, I haven't yet seen a web application without a ton of external
metrics related to the urls in the app. If our tests are written against
urls too, after some data munging (primary keys and actual form values
surely won't match test values exactly, but translating them to <code>GET to 
view 1</code>, <code>POST to view 2</code>) we can correlate our tests with these 
metrics. </p>
<p>Some such metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>application (webserver) access logs</li>
<li>Google Analytics or equivalent</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we learn from these correlations/comparisons?</p>
<ul>
<li>are we concentrating our tests in the least visited areas?</li>
<li>are we testing what our users are doing? Sure, it's nice that in our
    tests people sequentially finish their checkout, without wondering
    off the known path, but is this how they behave in production?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testcase-similarity-analysis">TestCase similarity analysis</h2>
<p>Some test scenarios will come up in multiple aspects of the system. 
Placing an order will trigger a bunch of actions in other modules - 
fulfillment, customer profile updates, marketing classification, invoice
rendering, notification emails, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes these features are added with big time gaps in between, maybe
even the team members have changed over time. The ability to compare 
the requests the different TestCases make, and say that these two 
(three, four, etc.) TestCases seem to execute the same kind of requests
up to a point as the TestCase being added, but they also have the 
following extra paths they all execute, but the new TestCase doesn't...
Causing the developer to realize - of course, there are special rules
for orders from educational institutions!</p>
<h2 id="reducing-the-gap-between-end-user-error-reports-and-tests">Reducing the gap between end user error reports and tests</h2>
<p>Probably this is the least unexpected idea in the list, but worth 
stating nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="in-place-help-for-trusted-users">In place help (for trusted users)</h2>
<p>Sure, this might require careful considerations, but giving the users 
the ability to browse the test cases/methods that matches their workflow
up to the current page, in a searchable fashion (if I place an order 
like this now, when will the X email be sent) could greatly reduce 
support work for the developer team. <em>Note: the purpose of this is not 
to isolate the developers from the users!!!</em></p>
<h2 id="always-up-to-date-screenshots-and-videos">Always up-to-date screenshots and videos</h2>
<p>Those manuals that have screenshots from many releases ago... Adding (or
marking) some test cases to be linked against documentation sections, and
having the tests actually take screenshots about them or record them as 
video sounds like a pretty useful idea for me. One could go further, 
such as highlighting the values/input fields where the test sends 
input, and the parts of the page that are asserted against...</p>
<p>And if the support team has access to the same API, they could even 
create these screenshots/videos for the customer as they are answering
their question (Here, take a look at this video, this is how the thing
you asked for is done).</p>
<hr />
<p>There must be many more ideas out there - let me know about them, and 
I'm happy to add them to this list (or link to wherever you published
it)!</p>

      <description>A New Look At End-to-End Testing - Polymorphic and Fast</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>At the end of this post, there is a list of reasons why to work with 
end-to-end tests, but first please consider the post's idea on its own.
After that, I'm glad to have discussions about alternative/better 
solutions to the described (or omitted) contexts.</p>
<p>Please, read it first ;)</p>
<h1 id="terms-used">Terms used</h1>
<p>The below points are not intended to be full blown definitions, but
rather pointers.</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-End testing - as <a href="http://gojko.net/2010/03/31/tdd-with-complex-infrastructures/">Nat Pryce has said in one of his 
    presentations</a>, the ends are always farther apart than one 
    thinks they are. The purpose is to execute the tests through as much
    of the application stack as possible - from the front end at least
    till the storage mechanism.</li>
<li>Polymorphism - I use it here mostly in the way demonstrated by the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_Substitution_Principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a> - code written against an abstraction
    should be unaffected regardless of the concrete implementation of 
    that abstraction is given to it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="polymorphic-tests-we-are-already-doing-it">Polymorphic tests - we are already doing it</h1>
<p>Some of us already run the same tests on top of different code - we can
have multiple build platforms (x86 and x64, Windows and Linux, Python 2 
and 3, etc.), multiple configurations (SQLite and PostgreSQL), as well
as multiple versions of our dependent libraries (stable, latest release, 
and latest). What's common though among these scenarios is that the 
polymorphism happens largely <em>outside</em> of our codebase, and we don't 
have to think much about it when writing tests. </p>
<p>An example of executing multiple drivers <em>inside</em> our code is the use of 
Selenium tests - the same tests are run against Chrome, Firefox, etc. 
While each of the drivers is testing on the same level (Web UI), the 
actual browser drivers have different implementations, exposed via a 
common abstraction level - DOM selectors and event invocations.</p>
<p>Of course, most test code uses some level of abstraction to separate
the test logic from the actual page implementations.</p>
<h1 id="abstractions-page-objects">Abstractions - Page objects</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html">Page Object</a> pattern is used to help creating maintainable tests.
Instead of writing tests coupled to the implementations (go to this 
concrete url, wait <code>N</code> seconds for it to load, find and select the form
elements for username and password, etc.), these implementation details 
are hidden behind well named methods (e.g.: <code>open_login_form</code>, 
<code>login_with_credentials</code>, etc.), and thus are domain (client) friendly
and readable. And Page Objects can be composed together to build 
Application Objects.</p>
<p>Similar abstraction is used by the various Acceptance Testing tools,
such as FitNesse, Cucumber, and the other Gherkin tools - the spec texts
contain terms and values important for the business domain, and there
is separate code translating the spec's values and terms to call into 
the application and transforming its state into a format
expected by the tool.</p>
<h1 id="stripped-down-tests-only-the-script">Stripped down tests - only the script</h1>
<p>As seen above, the AT tools separate application logic from the test 
scenario's description.</p>
<p>Assertions have also been separated from test cases - either by developer 
choice, choosing to use a separate Assertions library like Hamcrest, 
instead of the unit testing library's own <code>assertFoo</code> methods), or
explicitly (<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#assertions">Mocha ships without an assertions library</a>).</p>
<p>Thus tests can really be focused just on the scenario being tested.</p>
<h1 id="fast-tests">Fast tests</h1>
<p>The single biggest disadvantage of <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/641-gogaruco2011-fast-rails-tests">end to end tests is their speed</a>. They are slow. And the more of them there are, the slower they are.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">Test Pyramid</a> recommends not having 
too many of them. Many architectural approaches (<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">hexagonal</a>, DDD, etc.) 
suggest keeping a lightweight core application, and to attach the 
persistence and UI layers to it at its boundaries, leaving these ports 
and adapters lightweight too. Most of the testing then happens against
the core, dependency independent code, making the tests fast. </p>
<h1 id="fast-end-to-end-tests">Fast end to end tests</h1>
<p>Drumroll... we'll do a bit of cheating, of course. </p>
<p>Not all the tests have to run every single time. Performance tests are
usually not done when TDDing - that kicks in either later in 
the deployment pipeline, or runs daily. Teams organize their tests into
fast, smoke, and slow suites. Locally (and as the first step in the build
process) only the fast and smoke tests are run.</p>
<p>Putting all the above together means that writing systems with two 
self- contained cores (the app domain itself and the test scenarios) 
easily lends itself to end-to-end testing that can be run on multiple 
configurations, to give confidence that the app works with all its 
components and dependencies in production - yet enable fast feedback
required for developers. The same tests can be run:</p>
<ul>
<li>directly against the core application with mocks, stubs, etc.</li>
<li>through the app's (http) UI via the given frameworks/libraries testing 
  tools (e.g.: <code>django.test.client.Client</code>) with an in-memory database</li>
<li>through selenium against the full stack</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, we can mix and match - selenium against SQLite, etc.</p>
<p>While TDDing, one can run the tests only against the fast core, after
that is complete, we can run the relevant tests with the end-to-end
driver, fix any mistakes that occur, check in, and let the build server
run all the integrated tests (using existing build practices to 
achieve speed)!</p>
<h2 id="in-which-contexts-could-it-make-sense">In Which Contexts Could It Make Sense?</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading this far - assuming you didn't just scroll 
ahead :)</p>
<p>The below list is by no means exhaustive, and as mentioned in the
introduction, there might be alternative approaches (please, let me
know!) - it's not a coincidence this blog is called "Exercises in 
public learning"! </p>
<p>With that out of the way, here are some contexts where this approach
could make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with a team where the skills both for testing and for writing
    good code are (yet) missing (<a href="http://5whys.com/blog/the-3-maturity-stages-of-a-software-team-and-how-scrum-fails.html">Chaotic team phase</a>).</p>
<p>As the joke goes, the only way to eat the elephant is one bite at a 
time. Same goes for learning - people can be overwhelmed to make 
the mental jump from manual to automated testing - throwing in good
programming practices can be too much.</p>
<p>Getting started with end to end tests that have decoupled driver
methods (even if on the <code>TestCase</code> class itself) is a great start - by
the time the tests become slow, if the team is bought into the idea
of automated testing, it can be refactored towards a core domain -
and inside that domain there still doesn't have to be proper clean
code (one step at a time).</p>
<p>In brief: for slow, gradual improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app actually has multiple interfaces for the same thing.</p>
<p>It can be due to A/B testing, or simply to accommodate the different
needs of different users (e.g.: for a webshop - there is the public
shop, the internal UI geared at the company's sales people, and the
API), multi-platform application (e.g.: mobile and desktop web, iOS and 
Android), etc.</p>
<p>If you test the checkout process end-to-end, then running the same
set of tests against each UI makes sense too - a single set of tests
to maintain and you know immediately whether all features work 
across all the views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catching unexpected bugs.</p>
<p>There is a class of bugs that can be caught by rigor, but I do slip
occasionally, ending up in a place where the unit tests are all 
green, but the application itself doesn't actually work.</p>
<p>Some real life such bugs I have run into:</p>
<ul>
<li>forgetting to place the actual input element on the page</li>
<li>encoding-persistence issues - an utf-8 database with a column
    that is windows-1250 encoded is ... unexpected</li>
<li>synchronizing data with another database where after the 
    required mappings it turned out said other database truncates
    our data</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above can be addressed retroactively via adding targeted
tests for that specific integration point, but if we are already
testing the corner cases (length, encoding, etc.) in our code, it is 
nicer not to have to learn about these "unknown unknowns" from 
production problems...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally some related posts from other people:</p>

</ul>
<p>There is much more to be said about other <a href="/2013/10/28/going-beyond-regression-what-other-benefits-could-end-to-end-testing-provide/">benefits of end to end 
testing</a>, but this post is already too long, so that will have to wait
for <a href="/2013/10/28/going-beyond-regression-what-other-benefits-could-end-to-end-testing-provide/">another post</a> (while waiting, you can read <a href="http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1183">Jason Gorman's 101 Uses for Polymorphic testing</a>)!</p>
