      <description>Facilitating the Global Day of Coderetreat Zagreb (and a little Nuremberg) 2015</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>This was the second Zagreb <a href="http://coderetreat.org">coderetreat</a>, and this year we actually managed to
organize it to take place the same day as the rest of the world :) Thanks to 
the sponsors <a href="http://toptal.com">Toptal</a>, <a href="http://goodcode.io">Good Code</a>, <a href="http://floatingpoint.io">Floating Point</a> and
the hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin">Zeljko</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maljosa">Aljosa</a> for making it happen!</p>
<p><img alt="the team working on the game of life" src="/img/gdcr2015zag/whole-team.jpg" /></p>
<p>Due to our last minute advertising, the participants were Ruby heavy, but 
still, the eight people coded in Ruby, Python, C#, Haskell, JavaScript, and
R throughout the day - quite a feat if you consider that two attendees were 
not professional programmers!</p>
<p>Due to a late start and time constraint we only had 5 sessions with the
following constraints:</p>
<ol>
<li>no extra constraints, just exploring pairing, TDD, 4 rules of simple design,
    and the game of life</li>
<li>evil ping pong pairing</li>
<li>void methods only + remote pairing with Nuremberg (Germany)</li>
<li>maximum 3 lines per method</li>
<li>no conditionals (later restricted to no booleans)</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="remote-pairing-with-nuremberg">Remote pairing with Nuremberg</h1>
<p><img alt="remote pairing from zagreb" src="/img/gdcr2015zag/remote02.jpg" /></p>
<p>As I've known <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoemmrich">Marco</a> from before, a few days before the GDCR we had 
a video call where we tested out the feasibility  of remote pairing (we've
tried <a href="http://tmate.io">tmate.io</a> and <a href="http://floobits.com">FlooBits</a>), and
deemed it feasible for a coderetreat (i.e.: can be set up during the lunchbreak).</p>
<p><em>Aside</em>: Planning is everything, but no plan survives first contact with 
the enemy. All pairs used <a href="http://teamviewer.com">TeamViewer</a>
and VisualStudio in the end.</p>
<p>We used the lunchbreak to pair people up using a direct videocall between
me and <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoemmrich">Marco</a>, but that is a cumbersome process and we'll try to
come up with a better one for next time (maybe use a Google spreadsheet
where each location can put down the interested parties' language, tooling
and communication preferences before?), but nonetheless all remote pairs 
reported having had fun!</p>
<p>Facilitating remote pairs is surprisingly easy, but only when the pairs use
the headphones which can be shared between two people - one bud in each person's
ear.</p>
<p>While it does require some prior coordination between the hosts (sync session 
start times, agree on the same constraint for the session, etc.), I do suggest
you try it out if you have the chance, especially if you haven't remote paired
before!</p>

      <description>Global Day of Coderetreat 2012 - Nuremberg</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<br/><br/><header> <div id="global-day-of-coderetreat-2012-nuremberg"></div></header><div class="post_prose"><blockquote>If you are not familiar with the concept of a  <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">code retreat</a>, listen to this  <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=728">podcast</a> (or read the  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/dnr/dotnetrocks_0728_corey_haines.pdf">transcript</a>).</blockquote>As you may remember, I've attended <a href="/2012/09/my-first-code-retreat-legacy-code.html">my first code retreat earlier this year in Frankfurt</a>. One of the reasons for attending was  that I had a nagging thought throughout organizing <a href="http://citconf.com/budapest2012/">CITCON Budapest</a> that I should do something locally too, and a coderetreat sounded just like the perfect thing. So I've came back with enough enthusiasm from Frankfurt to approach our CEO (Dirk) about <a href="http://www.paessler.com/">Paessler AG</a> helping me organize one in Nuremberg - and he offered the office to host it in and to pay for the lunch. Thus  the biggest obstacle was cleared.<br/><blockquote>The importance of this couldn't be emphasized. As I've seen on the <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Coderetreat</a> organizers' list, it has caused some headache and  worry for fellow hosts. And in addition to the fiscal support, my  colleagues went way beyond anything I expected - our sysadmins arranging the required technical &amp; security infrastructure, running <a href="http://www.paessler.com/blog/2012/11/21/other/paessler-is-one-of-the-hosts-of-the-global-day-of-coderetreat">the GDCR event on the  company blog</a>, and even non-programmer colleagues offering to  come by Saturday to help with anything if needed.  Thank you all, you made it really easy! (by the way, <a href="http://www.paessler.com/company/jobs">Paessler is hiring!</a>)</blockquote>Anyhow, this post will not be about the organization process, but about what I have learned on this day as a co-facilitator &amp; participant about code and people.<br/><blockquote>Another big thanks goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/marcoemrich">Marco Emrich</a>, a seasoned coderetreat facilitator, who helped getting the event off the ground and helped me getting  started facilitating (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch">Nicole</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/Ookami86">Johannes</a>  for introducing me to Marco!)</blockquote>The attendance was low (next time we'll schedule the start 30-60 minutes later), but I was surprised to learn how well the coderetreat functioned with so few participants. To ensure there is enough variety and that people have new pairs, we took turns with Marco coding (which we planned anyway in case of odd number of participants).<br/><h2 id="the-sessions">The Sessions</h2><ol><li>no constraints, getting familiar with the problem</li><li><a href="https://github.com/zsoldosp/zsoldosp-dotfiles/blob/master/bin/snippets/python/unitsofmeasure.py">no primitives</a> &amp; focus on the rules (fake out the world if needed at all)</li><li>Ping-Pong TDD &amp; naive implementation (with a switch at half time)</li><li>no conditional &amp; no mouse</li><li>baby steps</li><li>free to choose session</li></ol><h2 id="its-the-global-day-of-coderetreat">It's the <strong>Global</strong> Day of Coderetreat</h2>Even though we were only a few people here, it's been great to chat to the others elsewhere worldwide, saying hi to people doing exactly the same thing we do, just in various other  locations. While there were audio problems sometime, we didn't mind it. And next year we won't  bother with trying to schedule exact times for the calls, since we all will miss those times  anyway, but rather just rely on improvising video calls.<br/><h2 id="code-related-observations">Code Related Observations</h2><ul><li>It's really interesting to see other people programming. It is certainly not    something one gets to do during their day jobs (except maybe trainers, team leads, and mentors).   It is even more interesting to contrast the external observer's impressions/understanding   with the understanding of the people involved in the programming - the difference can be   huge. This might help understanding how many developers feel bosses/managers always misunderstand   their progress...</li><li>It's also interesting to track people across the different pairs and see whether    they bring their firm opinions (battle scars?) to each session or let go of them    to allow the opportunity to learn a different approach. This is not necessarily a bad    thing, but if you have plans to learn, beware of this and be explicit what you want to    learn - know whether you want to explore one idea and bounce it off/get it challenged by    many people or whether you want to simply see how others program and see if any of that    could be applicable to you. E.g.: it was pretty interesting to see how my F#/Scala inspired   ideas (case classes &amp; types) could be materialized in clojure. However, I have certainly   learned less about clojure than I would have had I let my partner do it as he would   in clojure natively (though the <em>no primitives</em> restriction was screaming   for types in my opinion).</li><li>We developers are really creative at finding (or at least looking for) loopholes in the   constraints. During the <em>no conditional</em> session one pair TDD'd a function returning a boolean   and claimed they had no conditionals in their code and were trying to convince us that   even the rest of the system wouldn't need conditionals to use this code... Or that returning   booleans is not an issue since they could refactor it into something that doesn't need to    return booleans once they get to the rest of the system... I'm certainly looking forward running    a <em>no return values allowed</em> session and see how people will circumvent that (and rationalize it   away)!</li><li>The longer you have worked with a tool/language, the more readily you accept and work around   its quirks. When we wanted to structure our tests the way we would describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">the four rules   of Conway's Game of Life</a> in writing (heading, then four subheadings, and then the concrete    examples under the subheadings) it didn't match RSpec's expectations at all. We agreed that both    structures (RSpec vs. the natural) make sense and we can understand how &amp; why RSpec evolved this way,   but we couldn't make it match the natural structure. This lead to a nice brief discussion about when    you want to deviate from standard tooling/processes and when one is better off following it.</li><li>Some people just can't put off the desire to finish the task. I will have to be conscious of this   in the future, and prod people more - e.g.: to ask whether this test &amp; app code meets their definition of   perfect.</li><li>Sometimes when things are hard, it is an indication that you are doing the wrong thing or solving the   wrong problem. E.g.: I wanted to write a test for our function to ensure that the function fails unless    it gets exactly 8 parameters (number of neighbors) but we were not supposed to use primitives. It felt   like enlightenment when my pair pointed out that there is nothing in the rules that mandate that requirement!</li><li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It">TDD as if you meant it</a> is really hard unless both of you are good at the chosen   language. I assumed Ruby and Python are rather similar, but learned quickly it is not the    case. While we had great conversations during the session, and I've learned some interesting things about   Ruby, we have not made much progress with the actual constraint.</li><li>It seems most people work on their desktop machines/docking stations, and thus their laptop is   a secondary device, where they have not invested in their environments that much, and thus   the no mouse constraint is much harder (e.g.: having ReSharper installed at work, but not on   the personal laptop).</li></ul>... and I could go on much longer :) Certainly, the coderetreat format is great, and I enjoyed both programming and facilitating (though the fact my German is not strong enough makes it somewhat difficult),  and I'm sure we'll do more coderetreats in Nuremberg. So keep an eye out for it on the <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events/event/search?q=Nuremberg">coderetreat  site</a> or on the <a href="http://www.softwerkskammer.de/">Softwarekammer</a> events page.</div>

      <description>My first Code Retreat - Legacy Code Retreat in Frankfurt on Sep 15, 2012</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<blockquote><p>If you are not familiar with the concept of a  <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">code retreat</a>, listen to this  <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=728">podcast</a> (or read the  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/dnr/dotnetrocks_0728_corey_haines.pdf">transcript</a>).</p></blockquote><p>While I knew about <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">Code Retreats</a> for a while, this  was the first I actually managed to attend). It was organized by the  <a href="http://www.softwerkskammer.de/">German Software Craftsmanship community</a> group, hosted by <a href="http://namics.com">Namics</a>, and facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch">Nicole Rauch</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/leiderleider">Andreas Leidig</a>. And it was great, thanks to everyone involved in putting up the event!</p><p>The <a href="http://www.coderetreat-rhein-main.com/learnmore-legacy">format has been described by others</a>, so I won't cover that. I have to say though that I really like the format and I wish I started socializing (in software related matters) first at a  code retreat instead of conferences or usergroups - the format of the  event guarantees one doesn't have to worry about uncomfortable silences to be filled with smalltalk. The day starts with coding, the retrospective is group talk, and with the exception of the lunch, the breaks are only five minutes long, and you are searching for the next programming pair  during that time anyway. Great way to get more comfortable interacting  with strangers about software! (And if you do want to socialize, just come early for breakfast and stay after the event).</p><h2 id="i_wonder_if_being_familiar_with_automated_testing_is_a_pre-requisite">I wonder if being familiar with automated testing is a pre-requisite</h2><p>My assumption is that one could attend a legacy code retreat even if  (s)he has no experience with automated testing, since</p><ul><li>You could learn the basics of testing from the pairs you are working   with</li><li>You can see it applied <em>in the real world</em>. The most common objection   I hear from people recently introduced to automated testing/TDD is that    it might work on greenfield projects, but cannot be applied on their    existing project</li></ul><p>So if you are (or know of someone who is) a person who attended such a  code retreat with no prior testing experience, please let me know - I  would love to know whether the above hypothesis matches your experience! Unfortunately all my pairs had prior experience, so it's still just a hypothesis.</p><h2 id="iteration_impressions_lessons_learned">Iteration impressions, lessons learned</h2><ul><li>Dynamic language IDEs still have a long way to go, so for now I'll    probably stick to Vim for python</li><li>While it's interesting to take a guided tour of a language you don't   know, the focus of the codebase is not on datastructures (only uses   lists/arrays) and thus you only catch a glimpse of the language. I'll   have to attend a normal code retreat to see whether this would be    different there</li><li>Giving a language demo is interesting, and you learn a lot about the   language too. People new to a language tend to ask questions about    things you take for granted, yet you may not know the answer to</li><li>Taking baby steps and not assuming anything is a Good Thing ™ - the   codebase is devious one, crafted with care to make you trip over. I.e.:   it is a proper legacy codebase, despite its small size!</li><li>The "never assume" advice holds especially as you move between    iterations. During one iteration we made a mistake that wasn't caught by    the regression tests. Since in the previous iteration (with another    pair) we had 100% (line) coverage, the fact that in the next    iteration we might not have that didn't occur to me...</li><li>Discipline is hard. I was totally carried away refactoring during the   last iteration. I had this craving to actually make progress with the   refactoring, and I caught myself saying things "were we responsible   coders, we would now stop to write some tests, but let's just move on   now", as well as tugging multiple pieces of the spaghetti at the same   time. While here I might be forgiven (after all, the last iteration    was a free to choose what to do (with) this codebase), it's an   important reminder that I should watch myself at work - I would have   never expected myself to get so off track in a matter of 10-15 minutes.   And I used to pride myself that I realize when I'm in a dead end and   have no trouble throwing away code to start from the last known good   state!</li><li>The code retreat format is great for teaching people the importance of   prototypes, I will keep that in mind for the future. During the    functional iteration we haven't made much progress, but on the train    home I did a quick experiment to start making it functional from the   outside in, starting at the main() method, introducing the GameState   as a subclass of Game, and each step returning a new GameState (while   still modifying the old game state, since the refactoring was    incomplete, as it usually is the case). This approach didn't occur to    me the first time, and had I not started from a clean slate, I would   not have thought of it if I were to continue where I left off the    previous attempt.</li><li>While the facilitators keep going around, we didn't always get deep    into the issues they commented on (e.g.: I think if the test case and    the test name express clearly the domain and the scenario, it is   totally fine to use a variable called <em>sut</em>, etc.). </li><li>However, there is a lot of time available to discuss with your pair,   not having to worry whether or not the code will be finished, which    is great. One caveat is that you do have a time limit on the    discussion, since you don't want to bore your pair and want to    actually write code, so you are forced to condense your thoughts.    Luckily, this limit is not as bad as <a href="https://twitter.com">twitter</a>'s</li><li>Theory vs. practice, a.k.a. talking the talk vs. walking the walk.    I've been guilty of this myself, describing how my ideal test case    would look like in theory, and what guiding principles I follow while   writing an actual test case. Then the pair politely points out that the    theory is great, but what we have here in the code is not a    manifestation of those principles...</li></ul><h2 id="the_iteration_i_wish_was_there_-_working_towards_a_change_request">The Iteration I wish was there - working towards a change request</h2><p>Each iteration had a different focus, and I assume that there isn't a static final (pun intended) list of possible restrictions and it evolves. So despite this being my first ever code retreat and being told that  these ideas wouldn't fit the format, I'm documenting them here, so that I can refer back to it after my next code retreats to see whether I still feel the same about these, since now I think they would be similar  restrictions like during the traditional code retreat when one is not  allowed to speak or use <em>if</em> statements in the code.</p><p>I really missed having a clear functional goal for the iterations, since one usually refactors legacy code when some new feature/enhancement is  needed - and it has a huge impact on how one approaches a refactoring.</p><p>One mistake I have (seen) made when working with legacy code is going on  a <strong>refactoring spree</strong>, touching parts of the codebase which  we don't  need to change. The danger of it is that we can easily code ourselves  into a corner for days and slip on the original delivery. If it ain't  broken, don't fix it (and this doesn't contradict the  <a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule">boyscout rule</a>). This issue has been exposed during the iterations, many of us refactored one part of the application that  wasn't business logic heavy, but was a low hanging fruit. While one  iteration wouldn't be enough time to finish testing that part, the  conversation around it (what test cases would be needed to provide  sufficient code coverage, what's the minimum refactoring we need to do  to achieve that, etc.).</p><p>I raised it during the final retrospective, and people agree it's an important aspect, but they suggested it's not fit for the format of the code retreat.</p><p>The other great benefit of having a clear goal is that they demonstrate how <strong>fragile</strong> the <strong>regression characterization tests</strong> can be. A  neat little change request to the core business logic would have left  us without the safety net again, and would have made us think back to  the previous iterations when we felt skipping writing a specific test  is safe. While everyone knows it, that doesn't mean we wouldn't fall  victim to it..</p><p>And if you prefer to see a concrete example, instead of just reading  through this abstract text, I have something like the <a href="http://anarchycreek.com/doubledawgdare-series/">Double Dawg  Dare</a> in mind.</p><h2 id="some_technical_notes_for_attending_a_code_retreat">Some technical notes for attending a code retreat:</h2><ul><li>doublecheck with the organizers what you'll need to attend. They    probably plan to send out a reminder/notification email before the   event, but I so rarely use my laptop in an online environment that   their notice was too late for me to actually prepare my laptop for   the event.</li><li>know your settings &amp; IDE. There are a ton of yaks to be shaved, and   many minutes have been wasted by setting things up. It doesn't take   away from the experience, but it did stress me a bit the first time</li><li><p>either know how to use git, or just create two copies of the codebase   so you can easily revert to a clean codebase after the sessions. We    had some problems with this.</p><p>git clean -x -f -n # remove -n to really remove them   git reset HEAD . # remove everything from the changelist in case you added it   git checkout -- . # revert everything below the </p></li><li><p>bring a USB stick, and if you are not using your own laptop during all    the sessions, make a copy of the golden master textfile onto it after    each of your sessions in a new programming language (my laptop was    only used during the first and the last iteration, so for the last we   had no sample output textfile we could work against, and it took some   time to obtain it.</p></li><li>bring your own keyboard and know how to change a mac/linux/windows    machine's keyboard layout (or install one). I have not been typing in    a number of sessions because of this (try typing on a German mac    keyboard, when you are used to windows US layout!)</li></ul><h2 id="in_summary">In Summary</h2><p>It's a great event, you meet great people, and I would be surprised if  you came away from a code retreat not having learnt anything new.</p>

    <strong><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/06671468907643091304">Adrian Bolboaca</strong></a> on <em>2012/09/21 10:44:14</em>: Thanks for the great write-up.<br/><br/>I have a kind of an answer for why I don't get to that session of change request. When I thought about the legacy code retreat and added a couple of sessions I wanted to have a more natural flow. I wanted to have this session also, sometimes in the end of the day. But as a facilitator I saw that the attendees do not really know the techniques so we are stuck into explaining the basics that they need in order to be able to handle a change request. During all the legacy code retreats I facilitated maybe the 7th iteration would have been the "change request constraint". <br/>I e-met Andreas and Nicole a couple early this year when we had a skype call about the legacy code retreat. Then I met them at the Socrates conference this year. I'm sure they are doing an excellent job as facilitators, and maybe they have some answers to this. My guess is that we need more legacy code retreats happening and only after a while when the attendees know better the basics we can start and introduce this session. Or maybe we can find together a solution on improving the current format.

    <strong><a href="http://pboop.wordpress.com/">pboop</strong></a> on <em>2012/09/23 16:44:45</em>: I agree with you. In my opinion a leagcy code retreat is about HOW to change the code not WHY or WHICH WAY in order to open room for a new requirement.<br/><br/>Every participant is free to let her/his imagination grow after (or even during) the retreat and play around with the code base, inventing new requirements and so on.

    <strong><a href="/">Peter Zsoldos</strong></a> on <em>2012/09/30 17:11:58</em>: Thanks for the comment and sorry for the late followup.<br/><br/>I didn't intend that section as a criticism for the facilitators. Since it can be misread, I would appreciate if you could point out where and how, so I can correct it to avoid anyone else misunderstanding my intent (re-reading my post didn't help, I'm afraid I have too much context about what I wanted to say).

    <strong><a href="/">Peter Zsoldos</strong></a> on <em>2012/09/30 17:12:58</em>: I don't know what the exact goal was behind creating the legacy coderetreat format. But I have always preferred learning not just a practice, but also its underpinning ideas and the limits of it. While I can practice refactoring on my own, there may not be someone around pointing out that not everything needs to be refactored. Both are important and have their places, and we seem to disagree about the latter. My thinking is influenced by seeing people (myself included) overdoing/overvaluing the latest pattern/practice they have came across (HelloWorldProxyFactoryImpl), without knowing the limits of their usefulness and knowing the difference between understanding something in theory versus doing that in practice - being told something is brittle/unreliable and understanding it on an intellectual level is very different from actually experiencing it. The latter tends to be easier to remember :)<br/><br/>But I might have fallen victim to offering a solution instead of raising a question. If the Nuremberg global code retreat will be a success, and there will be more following it, I'll be happy to immerse myself deeper into the code retreat community and see how I feel about this original idea after some time - one of the motivations for posting it was so that I can come back and revisit it later.
