      <description>Going Beyond Regression - What Other Benefits could End-to-End Testing Provide?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In last week's post, I gave a few examples about when <a href="/2013/10/23/a-new-look-at-end-to-end-testing-polymorphic-and-fast/">Polymorphic
End-to-End Testing</a> testing makes sense. In this post, I would
like to take a step back and list a few additional benefits that could
be derived from end to end testing in general, regardless of the fashion
they were written in.</p>
<p><em>Note: some of these points can also apply to non-end-to-end tests too,
that were written in a black box style with proper test abstractions. 
While it could be argued that then the system is that one component, I
would rather just focus on the benefits we can derive on top of the 
regression / specification of the system.</em></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> note this post has been filed under <a href="/category/untested-ideas/">untested ideas</a>
 - they sound good, but I haven't gotten around to implementing all of
them.</p>
<h2 id="big-refactorings-and-rewrites">Big Refactorings and Rewrites</h2>
<p>Change is inevitable, and they often violate previous assumptions. 
Sometimes whole components (or systems) have to be rewritten. Having a 
set of tests that operate on a much higher abstraction level (e.g.: HTTP
GET/POST requests) can provide the required safety net to avoid 
regressions and making sure all relevant scenarios are addressed.</p>
<p>Some changes where this Page (Application) Object abstraction has helped
us:</p>
<ul>
<li>when converting a single page checkout process to a multi-step 
    wizard style checkout</li>
<li>when the article numbers used in our system changed</li>
<li>when we had to synchronize data into a new system - we could just 
    expand our assertions in the end-to-end tests to make sure that 
    every known scenario is written correctly into the new system</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/09/23/Test-first.html">It's easy to reconstruct a system from its tests, but much harder to do
it the other way around</a>. It has been
great to only adjust a few driver API methods and get the same amount of
functional coverage as before, without having to rewrite the test suite.</p>
<h2 id="forces-the-team-to-think-about-the-user-interface-and-experience">Forces the team to think about the user interface (and experience)</h2>
<p>While it is not required, it often made us reduce the complexity in 
the UI - when we find that a certain step is being exercised by a 
method with a single parameter from the tests, yet that method then 
derives a bunch of additional parameters to POST against the page, it
suggests one of two things: </p>
<ol>
<li>we are missing some test cases for these extra parameters</li>
<li>maybe we don't need these parameters to be provided by the end user,
    but we could derive them in the application too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often the helper methods created can expose the need for additional 
support interfaces that won't probably come up during the specifications
phase, only after go-live.<br />
</p>
<p>Last, but not least, end-to-end gives us tests for the UI, yet the tests
remain maintainable - usually a single test API method is all that needs
to be fixed after template changes (and designers are even harder to get
to write tests than developers :)). <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/160929/on-failing-tests">Don't be afraid of many test 
failures!</a></p>
<h2 id="correlate-tests-with-other-business-metrics">Correlate tests with other business metrics</h2>
<p>While I recall people suggesting we run applications with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">coverage 
profiler attached</a>, the performance penalty is usually 
prohibiting.</p>
<p>However, I haven't yet seen a web application without a ton of external
metrics related to the urls in the app. If our tests are written against
urls too, after some data munging (primary keys and actual form values
surely won't match test values exactly, but translating them to <code>GET to 
view 1</code>, <code>POST to view 2</code>) we can correlate our tests with these 
metrics. </p>
<p>Some such metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>application (webserver) access logs</li>
<li>Google Analytics or equivalent</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>What can we learn from these correlations/comparisons?</p>
<ul>
<li>are we concentrating our tests in the least visited areas?</li>
<li>are we testing what our users are doing? Sure, it's nice that in our
    tests people sequentially finish their checkout, without wondering
    off the known path, but is this how they behave in production?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testcase-similarity-analysis">TestCase similarity analysis</h2>
<p>Some test scenarios will come up in multiple aspects of the system. 
Placing an order will trigger a bunch of actions in other modules - 
fulfillment, customer profile updates, marketing classification, invoice
rendering, notification emails, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes these features are added with big time gaps in between, maybe
even the team members have changed over time. The ability to compare 
the requests the different TestCases make, and say that these two 
(three, four, etc.) TestCases seem to execute the same kind of requests
up to a point as the TestCase being added, but they also have the 
following extra paths they all execute, but the new TestCase doesn't...
Causing the developer to realize - of course, there are special rules
for orders from educational institutions!</p>
<h2 id="reducing-the-gap-between-end-user-error-reports-and-tests">Reducing the gap between end user error reports and tests</h2>
<p>Probably this is the least unexpected idea in the list, but worth 
stating nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="in-place-help-for-trusted-users">In place help (for trusted users)</h2>
<p>Sure, this might require careful considerations, but giving the users 
the ability to browse the test cases/methods that matches their workflow
up to the current page, in a searchable fashion (if I place an order 
like this now, when will the X email be sent) could greatly reduce 
support work for the developer team. <em>Note: the purpose of this is not 
to isolate the developers from the users!!!</em></p>
<h2 id="always-up-to-date-screenshots-and-videos">Always up-to-date screenshots and videos</h2>
<p>Those manuals that have screenshots from many releases ago... Adding (or
marking) some test cases to be linked against documentation sections, and
having the tests actually take screenshots about them or record them as 
video sounds like a pretty useful idea for me. One could go further, 
such as highlighting the values/input fields where the test sends 
input, and the parts of the page that are asserted against...</p>
<p>And if the support team has access to the same API, they could even 
create these screenshots/videos for the customer as they are answering
their question (Here, take a look at this video, this is how the thing
you asked for is done).</p>
<hr />
<p>There must be many more ideas out there - let me know about them, and 
I'm happy to add them to this list (or link to wherever you published
it)!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>A New Look At End-to-End Testing - Polymorphic and Fast</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of this post, there is a list of reasons why to work with 
end-to-end tests, but first please consider the post's idea on its own.
After that, I'm glad to have discussions about alternative/better 
solutions to the described (or omitted) contexts.</p>
<p>Please, read it first ;)</p>
<h1 id="terms-used">Terms used</h1>
<p>The below points are not intended to be full blown definitions, but
rather pointers.</p>
<ul>
<li>End-to-End testing - as <a href="http://gojko.net/2010/03/31/tdd-with-complex-infrastructures/">Nat Pryce has said in one of his 
    presentations</a>, the ends are always farther apart than one 
    thinks they are. The purpose is to execute the tests through as much
    of the application stack as possible - from the front end at least
    till the storage mechanism.</li>
<li>Polymorphism - I use it here mostly in the way demonstrated by the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_Substitution_Principle">Liskov Substitution Principle</a> - code written against an abstraction
    should be unaffected regardless of the concrete implementation of 
    that abstraction is given to it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="polymorphic-tests-we-are-already-doing-it">Polymorphic tests - we are already doing it</h1>
<p>Some of us already run the same tests on top of different code - we can
have multiple build platforms (x86 and x64, Windows and Linux, Python 2 
and 3, etc.), multiple configurations (SQLite and PostgreSQL), as well
as multiple versions of our dependent libraries (stable, latest release, 
and latest). What's common though among these scenarios is that the 
polymorphism happens largely <em>outside</em> of our codebase, and we don't 
have to think much about it when writing tests. </p>
<p>An example of executing multiple drivers <em>inside</em> our code is the use of 
Selenium tests - the same tests are run against Chrome, Firefox, etc. 
While each of the drivers is testing on the same level (Web UI), the 
actual browser drivers have different implementations, exposed via a 
common abstraction level - DOM selectors and event invocations.</p>
<p>Of course, most test code uses some level of abstraction to separate
the test logic from the actual page implementations.</p>
<h1 id="abstractions-page-objects">Abstractions - Page objects</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html">Page Object</a> pattern is used to help creating maintainable tests.
Instead of writing tests coupled to the implementations (go to this 
concrete url, wait <code>N</code> seconds for it to load, find and select the form
elements for username and password, etc.), these implementation details 
are hidden behind well named methods (e.g.: <code>open_login_form</code>, 
<code>login_with_credentials</code>, etc.), and thus are domain (client) friendly
and readable. And Page Objects can be composed together to build 
Application Objects.</p>
<p>Similar abstraction is used by the various Acceptance Testing tools,
such as FitNesse, Cucumber, and the other Gherkin tools - the spec texts
contain terms and values important for the business domain, and there
is separate code translating the spec's values and terms to call into 
the application and transforming its state into a format
expected by the tool.</p>
<h1 id="stripped-down-tests-only-the-script">Stripped down tests - only the script</h1>
<p>As seen above, the AT tools separate application logic from the test 
scenario's description.</p>
<p>Assertions have also been separated from test cases - either by developer 
choice, choosing to use a separate Assertions library like Hamcrest, 
instead of the unit testing library's own <code>assertFoo</code> methods), or
explicitly (<a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#assertions">Mocha ships without an assertions library</a>).</p>
<p>Thus tests can really be focused just on the scenario being tested.</p>
<h1 id="fast-tests">Fast tests</h1>
<p>The single biggest disadvantage of <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/641-gogaruco2011-fast-rails-tests">end to end tests is their speed</a>. They are slow. And the more of them there are, the slower they are.</p>
<p>This is one reason why the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">Test Pyramid</a> recommends not having 
too many of them. Many architectural approaches (<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">hexagonal</a>, DDD, etc.) 
suggest keeping a lightweight core application, and to attach the 
persistence and UI layers to it at its boundaries, leaving these ports 
and adapters lightweight too. Most of the testing then happens against
the core, dependency independent code, making the tests fast. </p>
<h1 id="fast-end-to-end-tests">Fast end to end tests</h1>
<p>Drumroll... we'll do a bit of cheating, of course. </p>
<p>Not all the tests have to run every single time. Performance tests are
usually not done when TDDing - that kicks in either later in 
the deployment pipeline, or runs daily. Teams organize their tests into
fast, smoke, and slow suites. Locally (and as the first step in the build
process) only the fast and smoke tests are run.</p>
<p>Putting all the above together means that writing systems with two 
self- contained cores (the app domain itself and the test scenarios) 
easily lends itself to end-to-end testing that can be run on multiple 
configurations, to give confidence that the app works with all its 
components and dependencies in production - yet enable fast feedback
required for developers. The same tests can be run:</p>
<ul>
<li>directly against the core application with mocks, stubs, etc.</li>
<li>through the app's (http) UI via the given frameworks/libraries testing 
  tools (e.g.: <code>django.test.client.Client</code>) with an in-memory database</li>
<li>through selenium against the full stack</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, we can mix and match - selenium against SQLite, etc.</p>
<p>While TDDing, one can run the tests only against the fast core, after
that is complete, we can run the relevant tests with the end-to-end
driver, fix any mistakes that occur, check in, and let the build server
run all the integrated tests (using existing build practices to 
achieve speed)!</p>
<h2 id="in-which-contexts-could-it-make-sense">In Which Contexts Could It Make Sense?</h2>
<p>Thank you for reading this far - assuming you didn't just scroll 
ahead :)</p>
<p>The below list is by no means exhaustive, and as mentioned in the
introduction, there might be alternative approaches (please, let me
know!) - it's not a coincidence this blog is called "Exercises in 
public learning"! </p>
<p>With that out of the way, here are some contexts where this approach
could make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Working with a team where the skills both for testing and for writing
    good code are (yet) missing (<a href="http://5whys.com/blog/the-3-maturity-stages-of-a-software-team-and-how-scrum-fails.html">Chaotic team phase</a>).</p>
<p>As the joke goes, the only way to eat the elephant is one bite at a 
time. Same goes for learning - people can be overwhelmed to make 
the mental jump from manual to automated testing - throwing in good
programming practices can be too much.</p>
<p>Getting started with end to end tests that have decoupled driver
methods (even if on the <code>TestCase</code> class itself) is a great start - by
the time the tests become slow, if the team is bought into the idea
of automated testing, it can be refactored towards a core domain -
and inside that domain there still doesn't have to be proper clean
code (one step at a time).</p>
<p>In brief: for slow, gradual improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app actually has multiple interfaces for the same thing.</p>
<p>It can be due to A/B testing, or simply to accommodate the different
needs of different users (e.g.: for a webshop - there is the public
shop, the internal UI geared at the company's sales people, and the
API), multi-platform application (e.g.: mobile and desktop web, iOS and 
Android), etc.</p>
<p>If you test the checkout process end-to-end, then running the same
set of tests against each UI makes sense too - a single set of tests
to maintain and you know immediately whether all features work 
across all the views.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catching unexpected bugs.</p>
<p>There is a class of bugs that can be caught by rigor, but I do slip
occasionally, ending up in a place where the unit tests are all 
green, but the application itself doesn't actually work.</p>
<p>Some real life such bugs I have run into:</p>
<ul>
<li>forgetting to place the actual input element on the page</li>
<li>encoding-persistence issues - an utf-8 database with a column
    that is windows-1250 encoded is ... unexpected</li>
<li>synchronizing data with another database where after the 
    required mappings it turned out said other database truncates
    our data</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above can be addressed retroactively via adding targeted
tests for that specific integration point, but if we are already
testing the corner cases (length, encoding, etc.) in our code, it is 
nicer not to have to learn about these "unknown unknowns" from 
production problems...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally some related posts from other people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ayende has multiple posts: on <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/154273/limit-your-abstractions-and-how-do-you-handle-testing">swapping out the infrastructure</a>, <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/4218/scenario-driven-tests">separating assertions from tests</a>, and <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/4217/even-tests-has-got-to-justify-themselves">about which tests add value in his opinion</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There is much more to be said about other <a href="/2013/10/28/going-beyond-regression-what-other-benefits-could-end-to-end-testing-provide/">benefits of end to end 
testing</a>, but this post is already too long, so that will have to wait
for <a href="/2013/10/28/going-beyond-regression-what-other-benefits-could-end-to-end-testing-provide/">another post</a> (while waiting, you can read <a href="http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1183">Jason Gorman's 101 Uses for Polymorphic testing</a>)!</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="notes-on-my-note-taking">Notes on my note taking</h2>
<p>... or what took me so long to add the notes? Why didn't I take notes 
directly in the conference wiki?</p>
<p>After my second attended conference I became an analog/offline attendee.
Note taking is much easier by hand - you can draw, arrow things into the
right place, and I find deciphering abbreviations and shorthand much 
easier in handwriting than in on-screen text.</p>
<p>I don't like having a screen separating me from other attendees (and 
cannot type on tablet keyboards effectively).</p>
<p>Having to type up my written notes later forces me to revisit ideas in
more detail than if I'm just re-reading old notes where I might skip 
parts thinking "sure, I know what that was". It's a mind trick to force 
me paying closer attention.</p>
<p>On top of that, I become much more careful about what I put down into 
the notes - sure, it's still rather raw and nowhere near blog post or
article quality, still much closer to raw notes/brain dumps. But it's
much improved compared to the raw notes I had in my notebook. Having the
handwritten pages only makes sure I know it is <em>not</em> DONE, which I might
fall into thinking had I written directly into the wiki.</p>
<p>Of course, that's just me, your mileage may vary!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This post does not contain <a href="/2013/10/08/citcon-turin-session-notes/">session notes</a> (I'm adding them to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/">wiki</a>) but rather just tries to convey the atmosphere/feel
of the sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Are_we_doing_improvement_wrong%3F">Are we doing improvement wrong</a></strong>? Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a>, 
  inspired by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Managing-Improvement-Adaptiveness/dp/0071635238/">Toyota Kata</a> book, it described the two 
  Katas, and illustrated why measuring improvement by the output 
  (results) only can lead to missed improvement opportunities (e.g.: the
  book describes that before an improvement effort, line managers were 
  called in for troubleshooting 1000 times a shift, which then decreases
  two 700 a shift. The leadership's response was that this means either</p>
<ul>
<li>people are hiding or working around failures, which is bad</li>
<li>people stopped improving, which is bad too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so they adjusted the workload to enable taking full advantage of
  the bandwidth of 1000 improvements/introspections the factory was
  capable of.</p>

  into how interruptions can be a wonderful tool for knowledge sharing,
  mentoring and how they hide (or to be more precise, expose) risk 
  factors. I wish I had mentioned the urban legend about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#cite_ref-5">the QWERTY 
  keyboard layout's design origin</a>, but the point about 
  interruptions slowing you down enough to force taking a step back 
  didn't need analogies. And it seems we all have colleagues whose cell
  phones only ring when their owners, unlike the phones, are not 
  present...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_does_the_ideal_look_like%3F">What does the ideal software development process look like?</a></strong> 
  proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/aparker42">Andrew Parker</a>, closely linked to the first
  session of the day about improvement (towards the ideal one to one
  flow) is probably the one session that I left with more questions
  than answers - not just about the topic, or its conclusions (shorten
  the cycle time (effort) required for going from idea to getting
  feedback), but even about the open spaces framework (what if the 
  scribe wants to apply the law of two feet?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Low_level_test_code_/_library_bleeding_edge">Low level unit testing/assertion code patterns</a></strong> proposed by me,
  driven by my desire to learn what new ideas are present in this
  space. While I haven't learned of any new patterns, I left with a 
  much better understanding of how language embedded and enforced pre-
  and post-conditions (or code contracts in the C# world) can actually
  been tested, contrary to my initial assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Questions_on_the_right_level_and_amount_of_testing">Are we testing too much? / What's the point of code coverage? /
  Would a Test Tree Builder and Executor make sense?</a></strong> - this was a 
  merge of three topics, proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KishenPanday">Kishen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajmolenaar">Arjan</a>,
  and myself. It was the smallest session in attendance (it was the
  three of us and <a href="https://twitter.com/sietstweets">Cirilo</a>, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a> also popping by
  towards the end), but true to the spirit of open spaces, we were
  totally engaged. Plus <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a> demonstrated the need for more
  effectively transmitting information (when we brought him up to speed
  of what is being discussed, he just said "CITCON Australia 2009") or
  prior art - there is a kind of generational gap that exists between 
  programmer generations that could benefit from a few more bridges
  (though leaving enough of a divide so that people will still work on
  and solve problems that were previously declared "unsolvable"!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Had I not proposed any sessions, I would have loved to attend <em><a href="https://twitter.com/sf105">Steve 
Freeman</a>'s TDD Clinic</em> - it's always a pleasure to see great 
people perform, not to mention the learning opportunity. I also would
have liked to listen to <em><a href="https://twitter.com/ivanrmoore">Ivan Moore</a> describing the build setup
they have for their multi componented system</em> at work - I faced that 
problem years ago, topped with the plugin compatibility across multiple
versions problem, so would have loved to see what they did. And next 
time I'm in Budapest, I'll probably try to visit <a href="http://prezi.com">Prezi</a> again 
in case Jayson is around so I could take another look at their <code>fkt</code> 
system (and to listen to the <em><code>please</code>, <code>simply</code>, and <code>fkt</code> machine 
provisioning evolution story</em> again).  Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin">Zejko</a>'s 
session's about how <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> tests there system is easy to
find online, since - like everything else <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> does -,
it is open. But as I always say, it's so much better to leave a conf 
with too many good sessions than one with too little...</p>
<p>Another great aspect of CITCON is the dinner afterwards - even though
it splits into multiple small groups, it's real nice to talk with people
directly, both about non-tech (like explaining why it would
make a ton of sense for the Budapest Opera House to organize a summer
Opera festival) and tech (thanks to all who listened to my pet project 
ideas, and gave really useful feedback!)</p>
<p>The reunion-like feeling <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulJulius">PJ</a> mentioned during his opening remarks
was true for me too, but sadly I haven't prepared enough - I should have
organized more explicit catch-up sessions outside the conference, for I
couldn't chat with everyone I wanted to in enough depth - hard to do
when we are running additional sessions even during the lunch break!
Plus of course one doesn't want to give the conference itself an 
exclusive atmosphere - I still vividly remember my nervousness at my 
first CITCON, trying to overcome the inherent shyness to talk to people,
attempting to join their conversations...</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/capotribu">Marco Abis</a> again, who was
the remote-local organizer of the conference, for making it happen. I 
met wonderful new people, and learned (or refined my understanding) of 
many topics!</p>
<p>During the coming days, I will be adding my session notes to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/">conf wiki</a> coming days, and once I digested all the feedback I 
got during and outside the sessions, I will be writing up the <em>Tree 
Optimized Test Runner</em> and the <em>app-test DSLs to have multiple drivers
for a single TestCase</em> ideas in more detail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While poking around the

codec can't decode bytes in position 56-57: truncated \uXXXX escape</strong>.
I set out to reproduce the bug, but that is of course an iterative
process, like anything else in coding, so I set out to script it. Since
I expect I'll need this again, and someone else might need it too,
I'm recording it here.</p>

      <description>Own your data (or why did I move away from Blogger and WordPress?)</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog used to be two separate blogs, hosted at 
<a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>,
respectively. I've gone through some trouble to migrate their content,
hopefully without breaking urls to this <a href="http://blogofile.com">Blogofile</a> 
based setup. In the process, I have lost a considerable number of 
features and conveniences - so why did I do this?</p>
<h2 id="owning-my-data-and-platform">Owning my data and platform</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch (or put more
bluntly, if you are not paying for it, <em>you</em> are the product being 
sold). A prime example is <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>, which reserves the
right to display ads on your freely hosted blog, while <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>
probably enhances their advertisement profile of you - I don't know.</p>
<p>Even if these platforms don't do anything bad at the moment, they can
pretty much change the features available to you, or any other aspects
of their terms of service - remember that story about the 
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57560370-93/instagram-rolls-back-terms-of-service-after-ownership-dustup/">Instagram ToS change regarding commercial use of your photos</a>?
Sure, it turned out to be a misunderstanding and/or they backed down,
but theoretically they can do it.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn't a concern when I started out with blogging, but 
certainly is something to consider now that I am nearing post #42. </p>
<p>These considerations are of course applicable for other service 
providers beyond blogging, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>(sports) tracking applications - while I have not yet gotten around 
  to building up a website like <a href="http://www.susi-ralf.de/index.html">Suzi &amp; Ralf</a>, but I know 
  eventually I will want to create something with the trails of all the
  places I've been to, whether for fun or for an anniversary gift or
  similar - and most sites make it rather hard to export your data 
  conveniently (<a href="http://endomondo.com">endomondo</a> is particularly annoying, so I'm 
  real grateful for the easy zip-export of <a href="http://runkeeper.com">runkeeper</a>!)</li>
<li>social networks - does <a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, 
  <a href="http://xing.com">Xing</a>, etc. allow you to easily export your contacts and their
  contact details? I would be pretty upset to find myself without a 
  personal copy of that data</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I keep using services hosted by others, but I try to make 
sure I use one with a friendly <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">data liberation</a>
policy!</p>
<h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>backup</strong> - sure, it's almost a repeat of the prior point, but worth 
  noting. It doesn't happen as often as before, but there is always the
  possibility of <a href="http://blog.theoldreader.com/post/56209408824/important-update">data loss or service outage</a></li>
<li><strong>version control</strong> - being a software developer, this is almost 
  second nature to me - it's incredibly liberating to be able to throw
  all my changes away and go back to a previous, known good version of
  a post draft.</li>
<li><strong>offline authoring</strong> - I do a lot of my writing and hobby coding 
  during my train commute, with spotty internet connection at best.
  Working locally on my laptop with my favorite text editor beats any
  online editor widget. </li>
<li><strong>full customizations</strong> - sure, probably there is a WordPress plugin
  for anything I would want to do, but for a lot of the small checks, 
  it takes longer to find, learn, and configure the one I need than
  to implement it in <a href="http://python.org">python</a> - e.g.: checking the site for
  broken links, custom reports, etc. I should probably mention the html
  template customizations here too, though you might be able to tell
  that is not yet the highest priority for me :)</li>

      <description>Some Metaprogramming (Reflection) In Bash</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I needed to write a function in bash that would set an environment 
variable to that value, unless the variable has been already set. 
This is a typical metaprogramming (reflection, introspection, etc.) 
task. </p>
<p>However, searching for the terms I know (reflection, metaprogramming) 
did not yield any bash results, since the bash terminology is <em>variable
variable</em> or <em>dereferencing</em>. I hope the title of this post will help
other non-native bash script writers searching for the "wrong" keywords!</p>
<p>The trick is the <code>${!&lt;variable name&gt;}</code> construct - it will be interpreted
as <code>${&lt;variable name's value&gt;}</code>. An example</p>
<pre><code>$ a="aaaaa"
$ b="bbbbb"
$ echo $a
aaaaa
$ echo $b
bbbbb
$ variable_name="a"
$ echo ${!variable_name}
aaaaa
$ variable_name="b"
$ echo ${!variable_name}
bbbbb
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, I could only find it offline (thanks, <a href="https://www.xing.com/profiles/Dieter_Loskarn">Dieter</a>!). 
Armed with this kowledge, the function itself becomes easy -</p>
<pre><code>function env_or_default() {
    name=$1
    default=$2
    if [[ ${!name} == "" ]]; then
        echo "no value set for $name, setting it to default value $default"
        export $name=$default
    else
        echo "value for $name was passed in from the environment, it's value is ${!name}"
    fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, the <code>echo</code> lines are there just for illustration.</p>
<pre><code>$ env_or_default NOT_SET not-set-default-value
no value set for NOT_SET, setting it to default value not-set-default-value
$ export ALREADY_SET=already-has-value
$ env_or_default ALREADY_SET already-set-default-value
value for ALREADY_SET was passed in from the environment, it's value is already- has-value
$ echo $NOT_SET
not-set-default-value
$ echo $ALREADY_SET
already-has-value
</code></pre>
<p>Happy scripting! </p>
<p>P.S.: Krzysztof Wilczynski showed another <a href="https://gist.github.com/kwilczynski/5877621">trick to do 
this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>random_file_name() {
    local __return=$1
    eval $__return="'$(date +"$(basename -- "$0")_%s_${RANDOM}_$$")'"
}

random_file_name FILE_NAME
echo $FILE_NAME
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Continuous Team Switching?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<a href="http://douglassquirrel.com/">Douglas Squirrel</a> led <a href="http://www.citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Continuous_rewriting">a session at CITCON Budapest 2012 about Continuous Rewriting</a>, summarizing many ideas I've heard before from <a href="http://vimeo.com/43659070">Dan North</a> or <a href="http://forwardtechnology.co.uk/videos/32447325">Fred George</a> presentations into a really coherent evolutionary progression,  and took the concept even further. <br/><br/>Like other <em>Continuous</em> practices, this would be as much a  technical as an organizational-cultural change. It got me thinking about how this would change the team dynamics - not just inside a team, but in the context of the bigger organization.<br/><br/>The various <em>Continuous</em> practices always came about the realization that when something is rarely done, people will be bad at it and thus  it will be hard, ineffective and error prone. Thus if we simply do it  more often, we would get better at it.<br/><br/>Joining a new team and becoming an effective contributor is a process that is in need of improvement (on most teams). Getting to grips with the inherent domain complexity and the piled on technical complexity, learning the tricks and workarounds, etc. can hold back someone from being efficient for quite a while. On the other hand, having a fresh set of eyes can provide  a new perspective and expose much of the technical debt the team has.<br/><br/>All the continuous rewrite examples so far have reduced the code size, making it understandable (though often this reduction came thanks to better understanding of the domain).<br/><br/>Assuming the reduced code size enables speedier onboarding of new team members,  while still benefiting from the new perspective it brings, what would  more frequently rotating in and out rotation team members (while never completely  replacing any one team) result in?<br/><ul><li>Could this make spreading of ideas and practices within a company    more effective and faster than the current silo'd, departmental setups?</li><li>Would it speed up the on the job, just in time learning of every<br/>  developer in the company?</li><li>Would it improve the skill level of every developer, or would it   drag everyone down?</li><li>Would it strengthen the company culture, simply since each person    would know more other employees (given that many of us only socialize    within our own team)? </li><li>Would it spark more cross-departmental improvements - unlike    accountants or marketers, developers can jump between various areas    and domains of the company with relative ease, and thus could see    potential improvements. Would this make crazy IT processes (where the data   passes through, without enhancement, several different teams and applications,   modified effectively by only one at the middle, then be loaded back into    the original source) extinct, making IT governance easier?</li></ul>I don't know. But it certainly was a fun thought experiment! Feel free to add questions to the above list in the comments!
<hr><ol>
<li id="1">
    <strong><a href="http://www.odd-e.com">Steven</strong></a> on <em>2013/01/19 15:42:41</em>: There are studies found that stable teams can improve as long as 3 years. From that I would recommend stable teams over switching team members in and out.
<ol>
<li id="1-1">
    <strong><a href="/">Peter Zsoldos</strong></a> on <em>2013/01/19 17:08:12</em>: Steve,<br/><br/>thanks for the input! Could you give some pointers for these studies (titles or links)?<br/><br/>I don't understand your second sentence (not a native English speaker) - you suggest that based on these studies, having a stable team is better/more effective/etc. than having constantly changing team members (the thought experiment of this post)?
</li></ol></li><li id="2">
    <strong><a href="http://tamasrev.wordpress.com/">tamasrev</strong></a> on <em>2013/01/21 21:22:23</em>: Wow, this makes sense.<br/><br/>Let me add some anecdotal evidence: Every time I'm joining a team, I start to see tons of technical debt. Later I'm getting used to it. Sometimes I even miss the old code when switching to something new. This is the thing that makes _some_ outsourcing veterans (i.e. EPAM alumni) very efficient.
</li><li id="3">
    <strong><a href="/">Peter Zsoldos</strong></a> on <em>2013/01/23 20:38:18</em>: what is the thing that makes outsourcing veterans efficient? The ability to enter any codebase and identify the place(s) that need changing for the new feature/project? <br/><br/>To add to the anecdotes (hoping @jasongorman doesn't read comments :)) - you don't need outsourcing for that, enough if you work on maintenance teams that are responsible for more than one application. Though it might be more a question of attitude and/or confidence than experience with switches. E.g.: I never hesitate to follow a stacktrace into 3rd party code (or find out why I *don't* have a stacktrace) or simply load the source to compensate the unhelpful documentation. Kind of like the difference between junior and senior developers is that the latter are not afraid to voice their opinions/questions...

    <strong><a href="http://tamasrev.wordpress.com/">tamasrev</strong></a> on <em>2013/01/29 19:37:44</em>: Didn't the blog just swallowed my comment? Here it is again:<br/><br/>What makes outsourcing veterans very efficient that they have to work with and maintain several projects written by other people. They will learn both continuously improve the code as well as do fuckin quick fixes. They also learn how to adapt to different coding styles they see in their project pool. They can relatively quickly identify the problematic parts of a codebase and they can come up with change suggestions. However, a typical outsourcing consumer isn't interested in their opinion.<br/><br/>It's worth to mention that outsourcing veterans only have a *chance* to learn all this stuff. They can also burn out due to the mind-numbing tasks they have to do.

      <description>Global Day of Coderetreat 2012 - Nuremberg</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<br/><br/><header> <div id="global-day-of-coderetreat-2012-nuremberg"></div></header><div class="post_prose"><blockquote>If you are not familiar with the concept of a  <a href="http://coderetreat.org/">code retreat</a>, listen to this  <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=728">podcast</a> (or read the  <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/dnr/dotnetrocks_0728_corey_haines.pdf">transcript</a>).</blockquote>As you may remember, I've attended <a href="/2012/09/my-first-code-retreat-legacy-code.html">my first code retreat earlier this year in Frankfurt</a>. One of the reasons for attending was  that I had a nagging thought throughout organizing <a href="http://citconf.com/budapest2012/">CITCON Budapest</a> that I should do something locally too, and a coderetreat sounded just like the perfect thing. So I've came back with enough enthusiasm from Frankfurt to approach our CEO (Dirk) about <a href="http://www.paessler.com/">Paessler AG</a> helping me organize one in Nuremberg - and he offered the office to host it in and to pay for the lunch. Thus  the biggest obstacle was cleared.<br/><blockquote>The importance of this couldn't be emphasized. As I've seen on the <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Coderetreat</a> organizers' list, it has caused some headache and  worry for fellow hosts. And in addition to the fiscal support, my  colleagues went way beyond anything I expected - our sysadmins arranging the required technical &amp; security infrastructure, running <a href="http://www.paessler.com/blog/2012/11/21/other/paessler-is-one-of-the-hosts-of-the-global-day-of-coderetreat">the GDCR event on the  company blog</a>, and even non-programmer colleagues offering to  come by Saturday to help with anything if needed.  Thank you all, you made it really easy! (by the way, <a href="http://www.paessler.com/company/jobs">Paessler is hiring!</a>)</blockquote>Anyhow, this post will not be about the organization process, but about what I have learned on this day as a co-facilitator &amp; participant about code and people.<br/><blockquote>Another big thanks goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/marcoemrich">Marco Emrich</a>, a seasoned coderetreat facilitator, who helped getting the event off the ground and helped me getting  started facilitating (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/NicoleRauch">Nicole</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/Ookami86">Johannes</a>  for introducing me to Marco!)</blockquote>The attendance was low (next time we'll schedule the start 30-60 minutes later), but I was surprised to learn how well the coderetreat functioned with so few participants. To ensure there is enough variety and that people have new pairs, we took turns with Marco coding (which we planned anyway in case of odd number of participants).<br/><h2 id="the-sessions">The Sessions</h2><ol><li>no constraints, getting familiar with the problem</li><li><a href="https://github.com/zsoldosp/zsoldosp-dotfiles/blob/master/bin/snippets/python/unitsofmeasure.py">no primitives</a> &amp; focus on the rules (fake out the world if needed at all)</li><li>Ping-Pong TDD &amp; naive implementation (with a switch at half time)</li><li>no conditional &amp; no mouse</li><li>baby steps</li><li>free to choose session</li></ol><h2 id="its-the-global-day-of-coderetreat">It's the <strong>Global</strong> Day of Coderetreat</h2>Even though we were only a few people here, it's been great to chat to the others elsewhere worldwide, saying hi to people doing exactly the same thing we do, just in various other  locations. While there were audio problems sometime, we didn't mind it. And next year we won't  bother with trying to schedule exact times for the calls, since we all will miss those times  anyway, but rather just rely on improvising video calls.<br/><h2 id="code-related-observations">Code Related Observations</h2><ul><li>It's really interesting to see other people programming. It is certainly not    something one gets to do during their day jobs (except maybe trainers, team leads, and mentors).   It is even more interesting to contrast the external observer's impressions/understanding   with the understanding of the people involved in the programming - the difference can be   huge. This might help understanding how many developers feel bosses/managers always misunderstand   their progress...</li><li>It's also interesting to track people across the different pairs and see whether    they bring their firm opinions (battle scars?) to each session or let go of them    to allow the opportunity to learn a different approach. This is not necessarily a bad    thing, but if you have plans to learn, beware of this and be explicit what you want to    learn - know whether you want to explore one idea and bounce it off/get it challenged by    many people or whether you want to simply see how others program and see if any of that    could be applicable to you. E.g.: it was pretty interesting to see how my F#/Scala inspired   ideas (case classes &amp; types) could be materialized in clojure. However, I have certainly   learned less about clojure than I would have had I let my partner do it as he would   in clojure natively (though the <em>no primitives</em> restriction was screaming   for types in my opinion).</li><li>We developers are really creative at finding (or at least looking for) loopholes in the   constraints. During the <em>no conditional</em> session one pair TDD'd a function returning a boolean   and claimed they had no conditionals in their code and were trying to convince us that   even the rest of the system wouldn't need conditionals to use this code... Or that returning   booleans is not an issue since they could refactor it into something that doesn't need to    return booleans once they get to the rest of the system... I'm certainly looking forward running    a <em>no return values allowed</em> session and see how people will circumvent that (and rationalize it   away)!</li><li>The longer you have worked with a tool/language, the more readily you accept and work around   its quirks. When we wanted to structure our tests the way we would describe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">the four rules   of Conway's Game of Life</a> in writing (heading, then four subheadings, and then the concrete    examples under the subheadings) it didn't match RSpec's expectations at all. We agreed that both    structures (RSpec vs. the natural) make sense and we can understand how &amp; why RSpec evolved this way,   but we couldn't make it match the natural structure. This lead to a nice brief discussion about when    you want to deviate from standard tooling/processes and when one is better off following it.</li><li>Some people just can't put off the desire to finish the task. I will have to be conscious of this   in the future, and prod people more - e.g.: to ask whether this test &amp; app code meets their definition of   perfect.</li><li>Sometimes when things are hard, it is an indication that you are doing the wrong thing or solving the   wrong problem. E.g.: I wanted to write a test for our function to ensure that the function fails unless    it gets exactly 8 parameters (number of neighbors) but we were not supposed to use primitives. It felt   like enlightenment when my pair pointed out that there is nothing in the rules that mandate that requirement!</li><li><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It">TDD as if you meant it</a> is really hard unless both of you are good at the chosen   language. I assumed Ruby and Python are rather similar, but learned quickly it is not the    case. While we had great conversations during the session, and I've learned some interesting things about   Ruby, we have not made much progress with the actual constraint.</li><li>It seems most people work on their desktop machines/docking stations, and thus their laptop is   a secondary device, where they have not invested in their environments that much, and thus   the no mouse constraint is much harder (e.g.: having ReSharper installed at work, but not on   the personal laptop).</li></ul>... and I could go on much longer :) Certainly, the coderetreat format is great, and I enjoyed both programming and facilitating (though the fact my German is not strong enough makes it somewhat difficult),  and I'm sure we'll do more coderetreats in Nuremberg. So keep an eye out for it on the <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events/event/search?q=Nuremberg">coderetreat  site</a> or on the <a href="http://www.softwerkskammer.de/">Softwarekammer</a> events page.</div>

      <description>Book Review - Exploring Everyday Things with Ruby and R by Sau Sheong Chang</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Book cover image" src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/9781449315153/s.gif" title=""/> </div><br/>Disclaimer: I received a free (electronic) copy of this ebook (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022626.do">Exploring Everyday Things with Ruby and R by Sau Sheong Chang</a>) from <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a> as part of the <a href="http://oreilly.com/bloggers">O'Reilly Blogger Review Program</a>, which also requires me to write a review about it. That aside, I would have purchased this book this year anyway, and would have reviewed it on this blog too.<br/><h2>About me and why I read this book</h2>I have been programming professionally for about 8 years, mainly business applications and reporting, so I already have quite some love for data. While I haven't used math much in my day jobs, I liked (and was good at) it in high school, including taking extra classes - so I have learned basic statistics. Refreshing and advancing my data analytics skills is one of my goals this year, and reading this book was part of that plan - I have heard that R is one of the most powerful languages for statistical analysis currently available.<br/><h2>About the book</h2>The book is written assuming basic understanding of programming and sets two goals: <br/><ul><li>to awaken the curiosity in the reader to go out and explore things and search for explanation, models, and experiments to validate understanding; </li><li>to show you some basic, but practical R and Ruby.</li></ul>While the author intended each chapter to be more or less self sufficient, I have found it to be better read sequentially, especially the simulation chapters.<br/><h3>Ruby</h3>I had no trouble with the code examples, even though I have only programmed about half an hour total in my life in Ruby. Beware that the only knowledge you gain about Ruby is the bare minimum required, so you'll have to put aside your thirst for complete understanding of the language and its ecosystem. If you need to have a proper understanding to work in a language (which I don't think is necessary), you are better off either reading a Ruby book first or using your favorite language to obtain the data - the code is easy to port.<br/><h3>Making me curious</h3>I have had a lot of wow/a-ha moments, both about the topics chosen for discussion as well as the math/algorithmic ideas. You may find that you disagree with some of the conclusion the author draws, and it is emphasized during the introduction that the goal of the book is not to convince you about these conclusions, but to demonstrate the journey from question to conclusion in order to equip you with tools to enable you doing the same. This is mostly achieved. <br/>I award extra bonus points for mentioning the limitations of the used analytical tools - I don't think I would trust any book/article/blog post which presents something without its downsides!<br/>Not all examples are exactly everyday (e.g.: an analysis of going to work by car vs. public transportation would have been more everyday than how to simulate the flocking of birds), but they cover a wide breath of topics. The processing and analysis of the data is always challenging enough, plus your general knowledge is expanded.<br/>One thing I was missing is a description of a really important part - being a layman, how do I go about finding which algorithms to use? While it isn't a book about Research 101, a description of the search process would have been great. You can of course always google, but when entering a new topic I find guided search helpful - which are some of the trick keywords, which sites to prefer/avoid, etc. On the other hand, enough methods are described that just properly learning and understanding them would make me a much better statistician already. Once done with that I could just fall back reading through the R packages and methods, hoping that if I have seen a word before it would emerge from my passive knowledge when I'm faced with a matching problem.<br/><h3>The R language</h3>The book does a solid job to help you get started. It demonstrates enough language features to enable to you experiment with it for work projects (e.g.: use MySql as a datasource, create packages, etc.); points out the R component/library hubs to look for community packages; and recommends further learning resources. <br/>The <a href="https://github.com/sausheong/everyday">code examples</a> are like most programming book snippets - procedural, (mostly) everything is located in a single method/script. Not a tangled-spaghetti mess that makes one despise it in legacy code, only it makes for a lower signal/noise ratio and requires more effort from the reader. Guess its a genre problem, so if you have read other programming books, you shouldn't have any problems with this one. <br/><blockquote>Technical comment: the ebook isn't formatted to play nice with the Kindle DX, and while in print the code block might be only broken between left &amp; right pages, on the kindle it makes for awkward read.</blockquote>The exposed APIs suggest that R is a bit too ceremonial for my taste, but that could be abstracted away for the project that warrants R's use. I have also used a number of visually great .NET UI third party components that were a pain to work with from a programmer's perspective, yet helped us create a great product. Plus things that feel alien first become second nature after enough practice, so it isn't a big deal. I plan to take a look at NumPy as well, and defer the decision whether to dive deeper into R (possibly via using <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=813">F# 3.0 type providers for R</a>).<br/><h3>Overall</h3>The book hasn't left me in awe, but it didn't feel like a chore to read as some other books. I got the taste of R that I wanted when I picked up my copy to read. On top of that, I have learned about fun things, and it also added books to my reading (wish)list (e.g.: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/">The Grammar of Graphics by Leland Wilkinson</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Armchair-Economist-Economics-Everyday-Life/dp/1451651732/">Armchair Economist by Stephen E. Landsburg</a>, and more). This is no definitive guide on R, but to wet your appetite and get you started, it is a good one I can recommend without reservations.]]></content:encoded>
