      <description>CITCON Turin Session Notes</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>Finally got around to adding my notes for the <a href="/2013/09/30/citcon-turin-2013/">CITCON Turin 
2013</a> sessions to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=CITCONEurope2013Sessions">wiki</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="notes-on-my-note-taking">Notes on my note taking</h2>
<p>... or what took me so long to add the notes? Why didn't I take notes 
directly in the conference wiki?</p>
<p>After my second attended conference I became an analog/offline attendee.
Note taking is much easier by hand - you can draw, arrow things into the
right place, and I find deciphering abbreviations and shorthand much 
easier in handwriting than in on-screen text.</p>
<p>I don't like having a screen separating me from other attendees (and 
cannot type on tablet keyboards effectively).</p>
<p>Having to type up my written notes later forces me to revisit ideas in
more detail than if I'm just re-reading old notes where I might skip 
parts thinking "sure, I know what that was". It's a mind trick to force 
me paying closer attention.</p>
<p>On top of that, I become much more careful about what I put down into 
the notes - sure, it's still rather raw and nowhere near blog post or
article quality, still much closer to raw notes/brain dumps. But it's
much improved compared to the raw notes I had in my notebook. Having the
handwritten pages only makes sure I know it is <em>not</em> DONE, which I might
fall into thinking had I written directly into the wiki.</p>
<p>Of course, that's just me, your mileage may vary!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Briefly about the conference - the open space format is still the best
thing since sliced bread as far conferences go, and CITCON still brings
together wonderfully smart people. Year after year I leave it being 
thankful for pointing me to questions (and answers) waaay outside the 
proverbial box....</p>
<h2 id="sessions-attended">Sessions attended</h2>
<p>This post does not contain <a href="/2013/10/08/citcon-turin-session-notes/">session notes</a> (I'm adding them to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/">wiki</a>) but rather just tries to convey the atmosphere/feel
of the sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Are_we_doing_improvement_wrong%3F">Are we doing improvement wrong</a></strong>? Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a>, 
  inspired by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Kata-Managing-Improvement-Adaptiveness/dp/0071635238/">Toyota Kata</a> book, it described the two 
  Katas, and illustrated why measuring improvement by the output 
  (results) only can lead to missed improvement opportunities (e.g.: the
  book describes that before an improvement effort, line managers were 
  called in for troubleshooting 1000 times a shift, which then decreases
  two 700 a shift. The leadership's response was that this means either</p>
<ul>
<li>people are hiding or working around failures, which is bad</li>
<li>people stopped improving, which is bad too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so they adjusted the workload to enable taking full advantage of
  the bandwidth of 1000 improvements/introspections the factory was
  capable of.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Continuous_Interruptions">Continuous interruptions</a></strong> Proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KishenPanday">Kishen</a>, we dug deep
  into how interruptions can be a wonderful tool for knowledge sharing,
  mentoring and how they hide (or to be more precise, expose) risk 
  factors. I wish I had mentioned the urban legend about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#cite_ref-5">the QWERTY 
  keyboard layout's design origin</a>, but the point about 
  interruptions slowing you down enough to force taking a step back 
  didn't need analogies. And it seems we all have colleagues whose cell
  phones only ring when their owners, unlike the phones, are not 
  present...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=What_does_the_ideal_look_like%3F">What does the ideal software development process look like?</a></strong> 
  proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/aparker42">Andrew Parker</a>, closely linked to the first
  session of the day about improvement (towards the ideal one to one
  flow) is probably the one session that I left with more questions
  than answers - not just about the topic, or its conclusions (shorten
  the cycle time (effort) required for going from idea to getting
  feedback), but even about the open spaces framework (what if the 
  scribe wants to apply the law of two feet?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Low_level_test_code_/_library_bleeding_edge">Low level unit testing/assertion code patterns</a></strong> proposed by me,
  driven by my desire to learn what new ideas are present in this
  space. While I haven't learned of any new patterns, I left with a 
  much better understanding of how language embedded and enforced pre-
  and post-conditions (or code contracts in the C# world) can actually
  been tested, contrary to my initial assumption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Questions_on_the_right_level_and_amount_of_testing">Are we testing too much? / What's the point of code coverage? /
  Would a Test Tree Builder and Executor make sense?</a></strong> - this was a 
  merge of three topics, proposed by <a href="https://twitter.com/KishenPanday">Kishen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajmolenaar">Arjan</a>,
  and myself. It was the smallest session in attendance (it was the
  three of us and <a href="https://twitter.com/sietstweets">Cirilo</a>, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a> also popping by
  towards the end), but true to the spirit of open spaces, we were
  totally engaged. Plus <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeffrey">Jeffrey</a> demonstrated the need for more
  effectively transmitting information (when we brought him up to speed
  of what is being discussed, he just said "CITCON Australia 2009") or
  prior art - there is a kind of generational gap that exists between 
  programmer generations that could benefit from a few more bridges
  (though leaving enough of a divide so that people will still work on
  and solve problems that were previously declared "unsolvable"!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Had I not proposed any sessions, I would have loved to attend <em><a href="https://twitter.com/sf105">Steve 
Freeman</a>'s TDD Clinic</em> - it's always a pleasure to see great 
people perform, not to mention the learning opportunity. I also would
have liked to listen to <em><a href="https://twitter.com/ivanrmoore">Ivan Moore</a> describing the build setup
they have for their multi componented system</em> at work - I faced that 
problem years ago, topped with the plugin compatibility across multiple
versions problem, so would have loved to see what they did. And next 
time I'm in Budapest, I'll probably try to visit <a href="http://prezi.com">Prezi</a> again 
in case Jayson is around so I could take another look at their <code>fkt</code> 
system (and to listen to the <em><code>please</code>, <code>simply</code>, and <code>fkt</code> machine 
provisioning evolution story</em> again).  Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeljkofilipin">Zejko</a>'s 
session's about how <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> tests there system is easy to
find online, since - like everything else <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> does -,
it is open. But as I always say, it's so much better to leave a conf 
with too many good sessions than one with too little...</p>
<p>Another great aspect of CITCON is the dinner afterwards - even though
it splits into multiple small groups, it's real nice to talk with people
directly, both about non-tech (like explaining why it would
make a ton of sense for the Budapest Opera House to organize a summer
Opera festival) and tech (thanks to all who listened to my pet project 
ideas, and gave really useful feedback!)</p>
<p>The reunion-like feeling <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulJulius">PJ</a> mentioned during his opening remarks
was true for me too, but sadly I haven't prepared enough - I should have
organized more explicit catch-up sessions outside the conference, for I
couldn't chat with everyone I wanted to in enough depth - hard to do
when we are running additional sessions even during the lunch break!
Plus of course one doesn't want to give the conference itself an 
exclusive atmosphere - I still vividly remember my nervousness at my 
first CITCON, trying to overcome the inherent shyness to talk to people,
attempting to join their conversations...</p>
<p>In closing, I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/capotribu">Marco Abis</a> again, who was
the remote-local organizer of the conference, for making it happen. I 
met wonderful new people, and learned (or refined my understanding) of 
many topics!</p>
<p>During the coming days, I will be adding my session notes to the 
<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/">conf wiki</a> coming days, and once I digested all the feedback I 
got during and outside the sessions, I will be writing up the <em>Tree 
Optimized Test Runner</em> and the <em>app-test DSLs to have multiple drivers
for a single TestCase</em> ideas in more detail.</p>

      <description>CITCON London 2011</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<p>Given what a great conference <a href="/2010/11/my-citcon-london-2010-experience.html">CITCON 2010</a> was, when registration opened for <a href="http://citconf.com/london2011/">CITCON 2011</a>, I didn't hesitate - which turned out to be a good thing, since spots had filled up rather quick. So next year, watch the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/citcon/">mailing list</a>, and rush to the registration form!</p><br/><h2 id="friday_evening_-_open_spaces_introductiontopic_proposals">Friday Evening - Open Spaces Introduction/Topic Proposals</h2><br/><p>It was held at <a href="http://skillsmatter.co.uk">Skillsmatter</a>, so I assumed there will be no surprises for me there (great infrastructure), but since I didn't have to take the tube this time (picked my accommodation to be walking distance from Glasswell Road on purpose), I've quickly learned that <a href="http://maps.bing.com">Bing Maps</a> has little to no knowledge of Glasswell Road and Skillsmatter. So the first day I took a nice, leisurely, albeit somewhat longer road towards the location.</p><br/><p>The registration went flawlessly, ran by <a href="http://twitter.com/PaulJulius">PJ</a>'s mom. Great job!</p><br/><p><a href="http://twitter.com/PaulJulius">PJ</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jtf">Jeffery</a> made the introductions in their usual, entertaining manner. While it wasn't new for me, I was glad to see this time they emphasized that the schedule can change throughout the day - apparently it wasn't only me who had been surprised by it last year. And of course the schedule did change.</p><br/><p>Because <a href="http://twitter.com/builddoctor">Julian Simpson</a> couldn't make it, I introduced his topic (<a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Do_you_use_your_tests_in_prod">Do you use your tests in prod?</a>), and then two of my own - <a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=To_Feature_Branch_Or_Not_To_Feature_Branch">Continuous Release and Delivery in Downloadable Product Companies</a> and <a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Configuration_Changes">Why Most People Don't have a Rollback Plan for Releases and instead "plan" to Hack Forward</a>.</p><br/><p>The great thing about proposing topics is that even when it doesn't meet the threshold to have a whole session dedicated to it, a lot of people now know that you are interested in this topic, and find you to share their experiences about it during the breaks.</p><br/><p>To my surprise, we actually followed <a href="https://twitter.com/Jtf">Jeffery</a>'s recommendation and we didn't run side conversations during the proposals, so the process was smooth and efficient, and there was more than enough time to chat later - especially that I didn't worry much about the agenda, since proposing two topics made my priorities to attend those, and I knew that whatever agenda we'll have at Friday closing time is not final.</p><br/><p>As we learned the next day, when you propose a topic, you should be careful which words to use. In my case, rollback was a terrible word, since many interpreted as going back in time, undoing, while what I meant was more like backout (planned and disciplined retreat).</p><br/><h2 id="sessions_i_attended">Sessions I attended</h2><br/><p>I've added my notes on the <a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#CITCON_Europe_2011_London">conference wiki</a>:</p><br/><ul><br/><li><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=To_Feature_Branch_Or_Not_To_Feature_Branch">Feature Branching, Feature toggles, What Makes a Build a Release</a></li><br/><li><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Configuration_Changes">Releases without things going wrong + why few make backout plans</a> </li><br/><li><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Do_you_use_your_tests_in_prod">Do you use your tests in prod</a></li><br/><li><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Organizational_Anthropology">Organizational Anthropology</a></li><br/></ul><br/><h2 id="sessions_i_wish_i_attended">Sessions I wish I attended</h2><br/><ul><br/><li><a href="http://www.thetestingplanet.com/2011/11/bitbeambot-the-angry-birds-playing-mobile-testing-robot/">BitbeamBot: The Angry Birds Playing, Mobile Testing Robot</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/hugs">Jason Huggins</a> ran a session about automated UI testing of touch screens</li><br/><li>there was a TDD session - given that often I need (want) to explain TDD to people new to the concept, it would have been a great learning opportunity seeing someone (was it run by <a href="http://twitter.com/sf105">Steve Freeman</a>?) else's approach to introducing it. Plus likely I would have gained a new understanding of TDD... </li><br/><li>Backyard beekeeping - I ended up in a random chat, but I was would have been curious to see these non-technical, non-work related sessions</li><br/><li>I couldn't stay long enough in the <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">Slaughtered Lamb</a></li><br/></ul><br/><h2 id="the_hallway_chats">The hallway chats</h2><br/><p>While open spaces are already like an unconference, nonetheless a lot of great conversations took place during the breaks (didn't get to use the law of two feet this time either), and I've met a lot of great people. I just wish I had more time to talk more with each of them. Guess I queued these conversations for future processing on twitter or via email. </p><br/><p>In contrast to last year's conference, I spent almost the whole time offline, in the analog world, and it didn't feel the least bit wrong. I've pretty much only used twitter when I followed someone on twitter - instead of exchanging emails or business card. Though I have to admit, business cards are great for jotting down small reminder notes on them.</p><br/><h2 id="some_travel_lessons_ive_learned">Some travel lessons I've learned</h2><br/><p>While this is tangential to CITCON, I have learnt a few lessons on this trip. I'll list them here, hoping it's beneficial for others.</p><br/><ul><br/><li>have your travel plans printed out (a'la <a href="http://tripit.com">TripIt</a>. It made the check-in process much smoother, and going from the airport to my hotel was perfectly relaxed, knowing exactly which tube to take. The only part I forgot to plan was from the Nueremberg Airport to the office (only remembered that would be useful when I landed). Thanks to <a href="http://www.manager-tools.com/2011/07/create-a-trip-folder">Career Tools</a> for the idea (and they great advice for attending conferences, approaching your boss about sending you to a conference, and more)!</li><br/><li>Phones, data plans, roaming. While this isn't the reason that I always buy my phones from the stores and not from the carriers, being able to just buy a prepaid SIM in London made a huge difference. It's not necessarily the money, though I think I've saved there (for the four days I stayed, just the data plan would have cost me 14 €, and there are the calls I made - contrast that with the £15), but rather that making a call or using mobile net wasn't something that I had to consciously  choose (is it worth the extra roaming charge?).</li><br/><li>have enough slack in your trip. I arrived Friday afternoon, and returned home on Monday morning. This allowed me to dedicate Friday and Saturday to the conference (and the Slaughtered Lamb afterwards), be able to meet up with friends living in London on Sunday, and the fact that some of my friends were an hour late just simply didn't cause a problem. And financially it doesn't have to be more expensive - I believe I spent about the same amount on the three nights' stay as I did last year for two nights. Advance planning, more research for accommodation helps you with that.</li><br/><li>If you need travel accessories (e.g.: AC adapter for the UK), try them before leaving home - I managed to buy adapters incompatible with my laptop's charger. Luckily the reception at my hotel managed to find one of theirs that was compatible, but it took a long five minutes for them to find one, so I wouldn't rely on this</li><br/><li>In addition to that, I forgot my phone charger at home, and while Bing Maps isn't perfect, it's much better than walking in London without a GPS. Lesson learned: it's handy when you have a USB cable with you that you can use to charge from somebody's laptop - the 10 cm long USB cable fits in any pocket.</li><br/></ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<h1><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: medium;">This was both my first </span></span><a href="http://citconf.com/london2010" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal; font-size: medium; ">citcon </a><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: medium;">(apparently pronounced "kitcon") and open space conference I've attended, and I'm sure it hasn't been the last for either one!</span></span></h1><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">The venue was the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skillsmatter Exchange</a>, which was simple in appearance (guess it's a former warehouse of sort), but with enough space, flipcharts, tables, projectors, seats needed for this event. There was enough space to chat without disturbing sessions, or to just grab a coffee - which seemed to be sufficient for this conference (and for my needs/expectations).</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Friday evening was dedicated for introductions and for session proposals, topic merging, voting, and of course, some beer. It was a nice reminder that my problems are not unique - I've actually stepped out from the proposals line given that a number people already suggested topics that covered my problem. Maybe it was more to do with the fact that I'm still not comfortable speaking in front of big audiences (more than 20-30 people make me nervous. Guess I'll just have to practice, given that there was a time when any public speaking used to scare me.).</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Saturday morning the schedule was supposedly finalized by the end of the breakfest provided. Later on it turned out not to be the case, so I've missed a couple of sessions, though all I've attended were great. Having a problem to choose from many good sessions is much better than not having any good ones to chose from. Nonetheless, I'll keep this in mind for future open spaces not to take anything granted unitl you are in the session.</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">The first session was about <strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Database_testing_and_deployment">database testing, versioning, and deployment</a></strong>. This is a topic close and dear to my heart, and it was interesting to realize the bounderies of the boxes I've been thinking in - e.g.: I've not been working in multiversion deployment scenarios, where you need to go from any version to the current. I've also learned to be more explicit in my communication, e.g.: when I asked about a <a href="http://www.agitar.com/solutions/products/automated_junit_generation.html">tool like agitar's</a> for databases to generate characteristic tests for regression, just because a few people nodded that might be useful, I've assumed everyone knows what I'm talking about, which led to a misunderstanding between me and <a href="http://gojko.net/">Gojko Adzic</a> about testing with "random data". Though we've clarified this after the session, I'm wondering why it happened that I couldn't explain it during the session.</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Before lunch, I've attended the <strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Managing_Multiple_Dependencies">module dependency handling</a></strong> session, where I learned there is no tool yet for handling versioned dependencies (i.e.: I would want to know if the version/feature branches of a given project are compatible with all versions of dependant projects). The discussion was nice, but I've had some trouble following once things got Java specific.</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Next up was the <strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Overcoming_Organisational_Defensiveness">Overcoming Organisational Defensiveness</a></strong> session. I thought I knew a lot about this topic, and was pleasantly surprised by all the new aspects that I learned, including, but not limited to:</p><ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><li>Don't fix your problem, fix their problem</li><li>while not everyone agrees, in certain contexts, un-branding a practice helps (e.g.: we referenced Dan North's example from another conference of not doing pair programming, but asking two people to look into a problem together)</li><li>when developers don't have time to improve, bringing in a coach doesn't solve the problem. You first need to dedicate time for them to learn.</li><li>instead of trying to change people, step back and see if you can create some change that would effect them in ways you would like, but doesn't require their prior approval/cooperation and you can do it yourself</li><li>don't just do 5 whys, do the 5 "so what?" too</li></ul><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "></p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">The next session's title was <strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Using_KPIs/Getting_a_data-driven_org.">Using KPIs/Getting a data-driven organization</a></strong>, however, the topic shifted to organization culture and psychology. Not suprisingly, we didn't find a silver bullet, but there were a number of good laughs and ideas (transparency, exposure, accountability, responsibility, over and undercontroling, ownership were the main themes). It was a smaller session, but in my experience that made it much more focused and interactive; contrasted with the bigger sessions. Plus I have been surprised, there are people using vim on the mac :)</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">The final session was <strong><a href="http://citconf.com/wiki/index.php?title=Beyond_Basic_TDD">Beyond Basic TDD</a></strong>, where the essence boils down to TDD having a marketing message that design will just evolve, despite Kent Beck admitting that might not always be the case (i.e.: if you've got people with good design sense, no methodology will prevent them from writing well designed code). There should be more focus on teaching programmers about design. Gojko took over from there to facilitate the discussion around what can be done to bring those familiar with TDD basics to the next level, I have to admit I've become quite exhausted by this session, something to keep in mind next time when organizing sessions around a whiteboard.</p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Overall, it was great fun, it was good to bounce ideas off from people, chat with random ones, and to talk with people known only from twitter. The one thing I regret is that I had to skip the after event pubbing (first evening I was just way too tired, while Saturday evening I was catching up with some friends living in London). Next time I'll try to allocate one more day for the trip, because the hallway conversations were great during the event, and I would be surprised if they were any worse in the pub. </p>
