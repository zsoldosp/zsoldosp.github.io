      <description>Slides for the Continuous Delivery talk</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
I gave a talk on Friday at the firm tech user group about the build/release evolution towards Continuous Delivery. The <a href="http://github.com/zsoldosp/zsoldosp-presentations/raw/28f95532bdb57b7f9a95a358b7b8835d513856ba/ContinuousIntegrationDeployment/continuous-integration-deployment.pptx">slides</a> are up under <a href="http://github.com/zsoldosp/zsoldosp-presentations/">my github presentations project</a>. It was built on top of <a href="http://www.agilealliance.hu/szakmai-anyagok/eloadasok">the Continuous Integration presentation</a> I gave at the<a href="http://www.meetup.com/AgileHungary/"> Agile Hungary Meetup</a> earlier this year (also on github, Hungarian slides only). Contrary to that one, here I was talking of things I haven't yet accomplished and only am looking forward to do, which worried me a bit - however, declaring this upfront was well received and it didn't pressure me from that point on.<div><br/></div><div><div>Though I wasn't as good as <a href="http://www.build-doctor.com/.../continuous-deployment-video-tim-fitz/">Tim Fitz</a> (especially lacking the experience) the talk has generated questions and discussion, which was the purpose, so I'm quite happy with how it went.</div><div><br/></div><div>My only regret is forgetting to record the presentation to review my presentation skills.</div></div>]]></content:encoded>
