      <description>Route planning</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          
<p>What better to do while lying in the bed with the flu than to plan the actual route?</p>
<p>It is a bit more challenging than just saying, well <a href="http://cambridgetochristchurch.wordpress.com/2010/05/18/day-13-crailsheim-to-donauwoerth/">Crailsheim - Donauwörth</a>  and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a>.</p>
<p>The main reason I can actually cycle home is that my girlfriend is taking a course in <a href="http://langenargen.de/">Langenargen</a> for a week. However, since we don't have a car, it's impossible for her to get there in time for the start of her course on Sunday, so she must go there the previous day. So going there together for a Saturday seems like a great idea - if the route from there is still doable within the time constraints (I have 8 days to get to Budapest). Based on a quick <a href="https://maps.google.com/">google maps</a> search it seemed so, so I went into the details (elevation is not such a big issue when driving a car, but for cycling with bad knees it certainly is).
<h2>Finding cycling routes in Germany online</h2>
<strong>Radweg</strong> is the keyword to search for. Finding routes today is much easier - there is so much available content blogged (<a href="http://radreiseberichte.npage.de/bodensee-koenigssee-radweg.html">trip reports</a>, and <a href="http://www.threehundredsixtydegree.de/rundtour-muenchen-bodensee-konigssee-muenchen/">more trip reports</a>) and shared via fitness tracking sites(<a href="http://runkeeper.com">RunKeeper</a>, <a href="http://everytrail.com">EveryTrail</a>, <a href="http://endomondo.com">Endomondo</a>). I have to say though that the route tracking sites are somewhat hard to use for long routes, so if I haven't found the 360 degree blog, I might not have been able to find their routes as one that might interest me. Also, until I knew the actual route's name, it was somewhat difficult to search for it :) The find the name of the route - <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r132.htm">fahrradreisen.de</a> was a great help there, and it has rough map sketches at the bottom, just above the ads. And <a href="http://translate.google.com/">google translate</a> can make a world of a difference (though I was pleasantly surprised I didn't need it all the time - I must actually been learning some German, not just trying to!) And then there is <a href="http://www.naviki.org/">naviki</a>, which ties together user's uploaded tracks, creating an incredibly full coverage for German cycling routes. Or routes people cycle on :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naviki.org/">naviki</a> is great, but has a few limitations (hey, it's beta!)
<ul>
<li>it doesn't know about "official" routes, so it will always give you the shortest route between two points - even if there is a mountain to cross, which could have been avoided by making a small detour. But you can provide intermediate points, just like with google maps to guide it to your desire</li>
<li>when you misspell or don't give the precise name for a town (e.g.: Wernstein vs. "Wernstein am Inn"), it hangs, and you have to reload the site, and start reentering *all* the data - previously entered location names are forgotten (and it doesn't trigger the browser's autocomplete feature)</li>
<li>you can only have 19 points specified (and sometimes less - no clue why)</li>
</ul>
<div>But these are minor things. And putting up with these does totally worth it, because</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>it gives you the elevation profile</li>
<li>and you can download the whole route in many file formats (I prefer GPX)</li>
</ul>
<div>I worked around the 19 point limitation by uploading the naviki exported files to Everytrail into a <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=1501308">single trip</a> (create the first one, then edit waypoints, +upload more gps file and it adds the points to the existing route).</div>
<div></div>
<div>So now I have a single view for my route options (included at the end of the post)</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Route options</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cambridgetochristchurch.wordpress.com/2010/05/18/day-13-crailsheim-to-donauwoerth/">Crailsheim - Donauwörth</a>  and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a></li>
<li>Langenargen - <a href="http://www.bodensee-koenigssee-radweg.de/">Bodensee-Konigsweg-Radweg</a>; <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r134.htm">Isar-Radweg</a>; and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.threehundredsixtydegree.de/rundtour-muenchen-bodensee-konigssee-muenchen/">Langenargen - Munchen</a>; <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r134.htm">Isar-Radweg</a>; and then the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Donau Radweg</a></li>
<li>Langenargen - <a href="http://www.bodensee-koenigssee-radweg.de/">Bodensee-Konigsweg-Radweg</a>; <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r18.htm">Inntal-Radweg</a></li>
</ul>
<div>And of course, from Passau to Budapest it's the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauradweg">Dona Radweg</a>.</div>
<h2>So which path will I follow?</h2>
<div>Don't know yet :)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm usually not the type to cycle uphill (bad knees), and thus I'm somewhat worried about the steep ascents in the <a href="http://www.fahrradreisen.de/radwege/r132.htm">Bodensee-Konigsee-Radweg</a> on my first day, but since it's only two real steep one, in the worst case I can just walk up with the bike and plan for a real short first day (it's downhill almost all the way from there, so I should be able to push those lost kilometers into the following seven days). And I have never yet been above 1000 meters with a bike, and it's tempting. Though from the two valleys (Isar/Inn) I'll probably choose the Inn, since I won't have much time to do sightseeing, and cycling near big cities is usually not pretty and fun - great for training/commuting, but not for a trip.</div>
</div>
<a href="https://twitter.com/360degreede">360degree</a>'s path is shorter and has less of a killer ascent in the beginning, but I'm not sure if it goes on dedicated cycling roads or it's just together with the cars - some of the roads it goes along seem to be main roads from the map.
