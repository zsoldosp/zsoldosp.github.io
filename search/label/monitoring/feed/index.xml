      <description>Green Build Surprises</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
          <p>Recently while working on our build process, I ran into an unexpected
surprise - the build server reported no error (i.e.: it was displaying a
green status, since all tests were passing), yet there was a major issue
- not all of our tests were run!</p>
<p>Given that the situation was caused by working on the build itself, the
issue was discovered in time (<strike>though somewhat accidentally</strike>
during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_testing">exploratory testing</a>). However, this was a
nice reminder of the problem with the "unknown unknowns" - now that we
know of this issue, of course we have configured alerting for the case
when the current build ran less tests than the build before. But I
wonder how many times we may have released on a green build with
regression bugs...</p>
<p>Asking some others and looking back on my past experiences, this topic
hasn't come up, so while I hope it is obvious and not news for you, dear
reader, I blog it just in case I wasn't the last to get the memo...</p>
<p>And it turns out that every now and then we do mess up and commit code
that makes some tests invisible to the test runner... So it wasn't just
a one-off thing!</p>
